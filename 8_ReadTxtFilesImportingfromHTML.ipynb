            "He had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the stairs. His closet of a room was under the roof of a high, five-floor house and was more like a cupboard than a place in which to live. The landlady who provided him with the room and with dinner and service lived on the floor below, and every time he went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which was always open. And each time he passed, the young man had a sick, frightened feeling, which made him grimace and feel ashamed. He was hopelessly in debt to his landlady and was afraid of meeting her.\n",
            "\n",
            "This was not because he was cowardly and browbeaten, quite the contrary; but for some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition, verging on hypochondria. He had become so completely absorbed in himself and isolated from everyone else that he dreaded meeting not only his landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty, but even the anxieties of his position had recently ceased to weigh upon him. He had given up attending to matters of practical importance; he had lost all desire to do so. In fact, nothing that any landlady could do held any terror for him. But to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her trivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats and complaints, all the while racking his brains for excuses, avoiding the issue, lying — no, he would rather creep down the stairs like a cat and slip out unseen.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, when he emerged onto the street that evening, he became acutely aware of his fears.\n",
            "\n",
            "“I want to attempt a thing like that and am frightened by these trifles,” he thought, with an odd smile. “Hm . . . yes, everything is in someone’s hands and they let it all slip out of cowardice, that’s an axiom. It would be interesting to know what it is people are most afraid of. Taking a new step, uttering a new word is what they fear most . . . But I am talking too much. It’s because I babble that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is that I babble because I do nothing. I’ve learned to babble this last month, lying for days on end in my corner thinking . . . just nonsense. Why am I going there now? Am I capable of that? Is that seriously possible? I’m not serious about it at all. It’s just a fantasy to amuse myself; a plaything! Yes, maybe it is a plaything.”\n",
            "\n",
            "The heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle, the plaster, the scaffolding, the bricks and the dust all around him, and that special Petersburg stench, so familiar to everyone who is unable to get out of town during the summer — all worked painfully upon the young man’s already overwrought nerves. The unbearable stench from the taverns, which are particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken men whom he met continually, although it was a weekday, completed the revolting misery of the picture. An expression of the deepest disgust gleamed for a moment in the young man’s refined face. He was, by the way, exceptionally handsome, above average in height, slim, well-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon, though, he sank into deep thought, or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness of mind; he walked along not observing what was around him and not caring to observe it. From time to time, because he used to talk to himself, he would mutter something, a habit to which he had just confessed. At these moments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a tangle and that he was very weak; for two days he had had almost nothing to eat.\n",
            "\n",
            "He was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would have been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags. In that part of town, however, scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have created surprise. Due to the proximity of the Haymarket, the number of establishments of a certain kind and the overwhelming numbers of craftsmen and workers crowded in these streets and alleys at the center of Petersburg, so many different types of people were to be seen in the streets that no figure, however strange, would have caused surprise. But there was such accumulated spite and contempt in the young man’s heart, that, in spite of all the cares of youth, he minded his rags least of all. It was a different matter when he met with acquaintances or with former fellow students, whom, indeed, he disliked meeting at any time. And yet when a drunken man who, for some unknown reason, was being taken somewhere in a huge cart dragged by a heavy cart-horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past, “Hey there, German hatter,” bellowing at the top of his voice and pointing at him — the young man stopped suddenly and clutched trembling at his hat. It was a tall round one from Zimmermann’s, but completely worn out, rusty with age, all torn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side in a most hideous fashion. Not shame, however, but another feeling akin to terror had overtaken him.\n",

Did he expect to see Voldemort staring out of them, afraid, perhaps, that their vivid green might turn suddenly to scarlet, with catlike slits for pupils? Harry remembered how the snakelike face of Voldemort had once forced itself out of the back of Professor Quirrell's head and ran his hand over the back of his own, wondering what it would feel like if Voldemort burst out of his skull.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He felt dirty, contaminated, as though he were carrying some deadly germ, unworthy to sit on the Underground train back from the hospital with innocent, clean people whose minds and bodies were free of the taint of Voldemort . . . he had not merely seen the snake, he had been the snake, he knew it now . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 A truly terrible thought then occurred to him, a memory bobbing to the surface of his mind, one that made his insides writhe and squirm like serpents.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 What's he after, apart from followers?\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Stuff he can only get by stealth . . . like a weapon. Something he didn't have last time.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 I'm the weapon, Harry thought, and it was as though poison were pumping through his veins, chilling him, bringing him out in a sweat as he swayed with the train through the dark tunnel. I'm the one Voldemort's trying to use, that's why they've got guards around me everywhere I go, it's not for my protection, it's for other people's, only it's not working, they can't have someone on me all the time at Hogwarts . . . I did attack Mr Weasley last night, it was me. Voldemort made me do it and he could be inside me, listening to my thoughts right now - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Are you all right, Harry, dear?' whispered Mrs Weasley, leaning across Ginny to speak to him as the train rattled along through its dark tunnel. 'You don't look very well. Are you feeling sick?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They were all watching him. He shook his head violently and stared up at an advertisement for home insurance.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Harry, dear, are you sure you're all right?' said Mrs Weasley in a worried voice, as they walked around the unkempt patch of grass in the middle of Grimmauld Place. 'You look ever so pale . . . are you sure you slept this morning? You go upstairs to bed right now and you can have a couple of hours of sleep before dinner, all right?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He nodded; here was a ready-made excuse not to talk to any of the others, which was precisely what he wanted, so when she opened the front door he hurried straight past the trolls-leg umbrella stand, up the stairs and into his and Ron's bedroom.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Here, he began to pace up and down, past the two beds and Phineas Nigellus's empty picture frame, his brain teeming and seething with questions and ever more dreadful ideas.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 How had he become a snake? Perhaps he was an Animagus . . . no, he couldn't be, he would know . . . perhaps Voldemort was an Animagus . . . yes, thought Harry, that would fit, he would turn into a snake of course . . . and when he's possessing me, then we both transform . . . that still doesn't explain how I got to London and back to my bed in the space of about five minutes . . . but then Voldemort's about the most powerful wizard in the world, apart from Dumbledore, it's probably no problem at all to him to transport people like that.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 And then, with a terrible stab of panic, he thought, but this is insane - if Voldemort's possessing me, I'm giving him a clear view into the Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix right now! He'll know who's in the Order and where Sirius is . . . and I've heard loads of stuff I shouldn't have, everything Sirius told me the first night I was here . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 There was only one thing for it: he would have to leave Grimmauld Place straightaway. He would spend Christmas at Hogwarts without the others, which would keep them sate over the holidays at least . . . but no, that wouldn't do, there were still plenty of people at Hogwarts to maim and injure. What if it was Seamus, Dean or Neville next time? He stopped his pacing and stood staring at Phineas Nigellus's empty frame. A leaden sensation was settling in the pit of his stomach. He had no alternative: he was going to have to return to Privet Drive, cut himself off from other wizards entirely.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Well, if he had to do it, he thought, there was no point hanging around. Trying with all his might not to think how the Dursleys were going to react when they found him on their doorstep six months earlier than they had expected, he strode over to his trunk, slammed the lid shut and locked it, then glanced around automatically for Hedwig before remembering that she was still at Hogwarts - well, her cage would be one less thing to carry - he seized one end of his trunk and had dragged it halfway towards the door when a snide voice said, 'Running away, are we?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He looked around. Phineas Nigellus had appeared on the canvas of his portrait and was leaning against the frame, watching Harry with an amused expression on his face.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Not running away, no,' said Harry shortly, dragging his trunk a few more feet across the room.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I thought,' said Phineas Nigellus, stroking his pointed beard, 'that to belong in Gryffindor house you were supposed to be brave? It looks to me as though you would have been better off in my own house. We Slytherins are brave, yes, but not stupid. For instance, given the choice, we will always choose to save our own necks.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It's not my own neck I'm saving,' said Harry tersely, tugging the trunk over a patch of particularly uneven, moth-eaten carpet right in front of the door.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, I see,' said Phineas Nigellus, still stroking his beard, 'this is no cowardly flight - you are being noble.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry ignored him. His hand was on the doorknob when Phineas Nigellus said lazily, 'I have a message for you from Albus Dumbledore.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry span round.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What is it?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 ' \\\\Stay where you are.\\\\\\\" '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I haven't moved!' said Harry, his hand still upon the doorknob. 'So what's the message?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I have just given it to you, dolt,' said Phineas Nigellus smoothly. 'Dumbledore says, \\\\\\\"Stay where you are.\\\\\\\" '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Why?' said Harry eagerly, dropping the end of his trunk. 'Why does he want me to stay? What else did he say?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Nothing whatsoever,' said Phineas Nigellus, raising a thin black eyebrow as though he found Harry impertinent.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry's temper rose to the surface like a snake rearing from long grass. He was exhausted, he was confused beyond measure, he had experienced terror, relief, then terror again in the last twelve hours, and still Dumbledore did not want to talk to him!\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'So that's it, is it?' he said loudly. ' \\\\\\\"Stay where you are\\\\\\\"? That's all anyone could tell me after I got attacked by those Dementors, loo! Just stay put while the grown-ups sort it out, Harry! We won't bother telling you anything, though, because your tiny little brain might not be able to cope with it!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You know,' said Phineas Nigellus, even more loudly than Harry, 'this is precisely why I loathed being a teacher! Young people are so infernally convinced that they are absolutely right about everything. Has it not occurred to you, my poor puffed-up popinjay, that there might be an excellent reason why the Headmaster of Hogwarts is not confiding every tiny detail of his plans to you? Have you never paused, while feeling hard-done-by, to note that following Dumbledore's orders has never yet led you into harm? No. No, like all young people, you are quite sure that you alone feel and think, you alone recognise danger, you alone are the only one clever enough to realise what the Dark Lord may be planning - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'He is planning something to do with me, then?' said Harry swiftly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Did I say that?' said Phineas Nigellus, idly examining his silk gloves. 'Now, if you will excuse me, I have better things to do than listen to adolescent agonising . . . good-day to you.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 And he strolled to the edge of his frame and out of sight.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Fine, go then!' Harry bellowed at the empty frame. 'And tell Dumbledore thanks for nothing!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The empty canvas remained silent. Fuming, Harry dragged his trunk back to the foot of his bed, then threw himself face down on the moth-eaten covers, his eyes shut, his body heavy and aching.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He felt as though he had journeyed for miles and miles . . . it seemed impossible that less than twenty-four hours ago Cho Chang had been approaching him under the mistletoe . . . he was so tired . . . he was scared to sleep . . . yet he did not know how long he could fight it . . . Dumbledore had told him to stay . . . that must mean he was allowed to sleep . . . but he was scared . . . what if it happened again?\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He was sinking into shadows . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 It was as though a film in his head had been waiting to start. He was walking down a deserted corridor towards a plain black door, past rough stone walls, torches, and an open doorway on to a flight of stone steps leading downstairs on the left . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He reached the black door but could not open it. . . he stood gazing at it, desperate for entry . . . something he wanted with all his heart lay beyond . . . a prize beyond his dreams . . . if only his scar would stop prickling . . . then he would be able to think more clearly . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Harry,' said Ron's voice, from far, far away, 'Mum says dinners ready, but she'll save you something if you want to stay in bed.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry opened his eyes, but Ron had already left the room.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He doesn't want to be on his own with me, Harry thought. Not after what he heard Moody say.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He supposed none of them would want him there any more, now that they knew what was inside him.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He would not go down to dinner; he would not inflict his company on them. He turned over on to his other side and, after a while, dropped back off to sleep. He woke much later, in the early hours of the morning, his insides aching with hunger and Ron snoring in the next bed. Squinting around the room, he saw the dark outline of Phineas Nigellus standing again in his portrait and it occurred to Harry that Dumbledore had probably sent Phineas Nigellus to watch over him, in case he attacked somebody else.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The feeling of being unclean intensified. He half-wished he had not obeyed Dumbledore . . . if this was how life was going to be for him in Grimmauld Place from now on, maybe he would be better off in Privet Drive after all.*Everybody else spent the following morning putting up Christmas decorations. Harry could not remember Sirius ever being in such a good mood; he was actually singing carols, apparently delighted that he was to have company over Christmas. Harry could hear his voice echoing up through the floor in the cold drawing room where he was sitting alone, watching the sky growing whiter outside the windows, threatening snow, all the time feeling a savage pleasure that he was giving the others the opportunity to keep talking about him, as they were bound to be doing. When he heard Mrs Weasley calling his name softly up the stairs around lunchtime, he retreated further upstairs and ignored her.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Around six o'clock in the evening the doorbell rang and Mrs Black started screaming again. Assuming that Mundungus or some other Order member had come to call, Harry merely settled himself more comfortably against the wall of Buckbeak's room where he was hiding, trying to ignore how hungry he felt as he fed dead rats to the Hippogriff. It came as a slight shock when somebody hammered hard on the door a few minutes later.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I know you're in there,' said Hermione's voice. 'Will you please come out? I want to talk to you.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What are you doing here?' Harry asked her, pulling open the door as Buckbeak resumed his scratching at the straw-strewn floor for any fragments of rat he may have dropped. 'I thought you were skiing with your mum and dad?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, to tell the truth, skiing's not really my thing,' said Hermione. 'So, I've come here for Christmas.' There was snow in her hair and her face was pink with cold. 'But don t tell Ron. I told him skiing's really good because he kept laughing so much. Mum and Dad are a bit disappointed, but I've told them that everyone who is serious about the exams is staying at Hogwarts to study. They want me to do well, they'll understand. Anyway,' she said briskly, 'let's go to your bedroom, Ron's mum has lit a fire in there and she's sent up sandwiches.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry followed her back to the second floor. When he entered the bedroom, he was rather surprised to see both Ron and Ginny waiting for them, sitting on Ron's bed.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I came on the Knight Bus,' said Hermione airily, pulling off her jacket before Harry had time to speak. 'Dumbledore told me what had happened first thing this morning, but I had to wait for term to end officially before setting off. Umbridge is already livid that you lot disappeared right under her nose, even though Dumbledore told her Mr Weasley was in St Mungo's and he'd given you all permission to visit. So . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 She sat down next to Ginny, and the two girls and Ron all looked up at Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'How're you feeling?' asked Hermione.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Fine,' said Harry stiffly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, don't lie, Harry,' she said impatiently. 'Ron and Ginny say you've been hiding from everyone since you got back from St Mungo's.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They do, do they?' said Harry, glaring at Ron and Ginny. Ron looked down at his feet but Ginny seemed quite unabashed.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, you have!' she said. 'And you won't look at any of us!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It's you lot who won't look at me!' said Harry angrily.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Maybe you're taking it in turns to look, and keep missing each other,' suggested Hermione, the corners of her mouth twitching.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Very funny,' snapped Harry, turning away.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, stop feeling all misunderstood,' said Hermione sharply. 'Look, the others have told me what you overheard last night on the Extendable Ears - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah?' growled Harry, his hands deep in his pockets as he watched the snow now falling thickly outside. 'All been talking about me, have you? Well, I'm getting used to it.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'We wanted to talk to you, Harry' said Ginny, 'but as you've been hiding ever since we got back - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I didn't want anyone to talk to me,' said Harry, who was feeling more and more nettled.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, that was a bit stupid of you,' said Ginny angrily, 'seeing as you don't know anyone but me who's been possessed by You-Know-Who, and I can tell you how it feels.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry remained quite still as the impact of these words hit him. Then he wheeled round.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I forgot,' he said.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Lucky you,' said Ginny coolly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Tin sorry,' Harry said, and he meant it. 'So . . . so, do you think I'm being possessed, then?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, can you remember everything you've been doing?' Ginny asked. 'Are there big blank periods where you don't know what you've been up to?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry racked his brains.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No,' he said.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Then You-Know-Who hasn't ever possessed you,' said Ginny simply. 'When he did it to me, I couldn't remember what I'd been doing for hours at a time. I'd find myself somewhere and not know how I got there.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry hardly dared believe her, yet his heart was lightening almost in spite of himself.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'That dream I had about your dad and the snake, though - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Harry, you've had these dreams before,' Hermione said. 'You had flashes of what Voldemort was up to last year.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 This was different,' said Harry, shaking his head. T was inside that snake. It was like I was the snake . . . what if Voldemort somehow transported me to London - ?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'One day,' said Hermione, sounding thoroughly exasperated, 'you'll read Hogwarts: A History, and perhaps it will remind you that you can't Apparate or Disapparaie inside Hogwarts. Even Voldemort couldn't just make you fly out of your dormitory, Harry.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You didn't leave your bed, male,' said Ron. T saw you thrashing around in your sleep for at least a minute before we could wake you up.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry started pacing up and down the room again, thinking. What they were all saying was not only comforting, it made sense . . . without really thinking, he took a sandwich from the plate on the bed and crammed it hungrily into his mouth.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 I'm not the weapon after all, thought Harry. His heart swelled with happiness and relief, and he felt like joining in as they heard\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Sirius tramping past their door towards Buckbeaks room, singing 'God Rest Ye, Merry Hippogriffs' at the top of his voice.*How could he have dreamed of returning to Privet Drive for Christmas? Sirius's delight at having the house full again, and especially at having Harry back, was infectious. He was no longer their sullen host of the summer; now he seemed determined that everyone should enjoy themselves as much, if not more than they would have done at Hogwarts, and he worked tirelessly in the run-up to Christmas Day, cleaning and decorating with their help, so that by the time they all went to bed on Christmas Eve the house was barely recognisable. The tarnished chandeliers were no longer hung with cobwebs but with garlands of holly and gold and silver streamers; magical snow glittered in heaps over the threadbare carpets; a great Christmas tree, obtained by Mundungus and decorated with live fairies, blocked Sirius's family tree from view, and even the stuffed elf-heads on the hall wall wore Father Christmas hats and beards.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry awoke on Christmas morning to find a stack of presents at the foot of his bed and Ron already halfway through opening his own, rather larger, pile.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Good haul this year,' he informed Harry through a cloud of paper. Thanks for the Broom Compass, it's excellent; beats Hermione's - she got me a homework planner - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry sorted through his presents and found one with Hermione's handwriting on it. She had given him, too, a book that resembled a diary except that every time he opened a page it said aloud things like: 'Do it today or later you'll pay!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Sirius and Lupin had given Harry a set of excellent books entitled Practical Defensive Magic and its Use Against the Dark Arts, which had superb, moving colour illustrations of all the counter-jinxes and hexes it described. Harry flicked through the first volume eagerly; he could see it was going to be highly useful in his plans for the DA. Hagrid had sent a furry brown wallet that had fangs, which were presumably supposed to be an anti-theft device, but unfortunately prevented Harry putting any money in without getting his fingers ripped off. Tonks's present was a small, working model of a Firebolt, which Harry watched fly around the room, wishing he still had his full-size version; Ron had given him an enormous box of Every-Flavour Beans, Mr and Mrs Weasley the usual hand-knitted jumper and some mince pies, and Dobby a truly dreadful painting that Harry suspected had been done by the elf himself. He had just turned it upside-down to see whether it looked better that way when, with a loud crack, Fred and George Apparated at the foot of his bed.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Merry Christmas,' said George. 'Don't go downstairs for a bit.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Why not?' said Ron.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Mum's crying again,' said Fred heavily. 'Percy sent back his Christmas jumper.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Without a note,' added George. 'Hasn't asked how Dad is or visited him or anything.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'We tried to comfort her,' said Fred, moving around the bed to look at Harry's portrait. Told her Percy's nothing more than a humungous pile of rat droppings.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Didn't work,' said George, helping himself to a Chocolate Frog. 'So Lupin took over. Best let him cheer her up before we go down for breakfast, I reckon.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What's that supposed to be, anyway?' asked Fred, squinting at Dobbys painting. 'Looks like a gibbon with two black eyes.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It's Harry!' said George, pointing at the back of the picture, 'says so on the back!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Good likeness,' said Fred, grinning. Harry threw his new homework diary at him; it hit the wall opposite and fell to the floor where it said happily: 'If you've dotted the \\\\\\\"i\\\\\\\"s and crossed the \\\\\\\"t\\\\\\\"s then you may do whatever you please!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They got up and dressed. They could hear the various inhabitants of the house calling 'Merry Christmas' to one another. On their way downstairs they met Hermione.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Thanks for the book, Harry,' she said happily. 'I've been wanting that New Theory of Numerology for ages! And that perfume's really unusual, Ron.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No problem,' said Ron. 'Who's that for, anyway?' he added, nodding at the neatly wrapped present she was carrying.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Kreacher,' said Hermione brightly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It had better not be clothes!' Ron warned her. 'You know what Sirius said: Kreacher knows too much, we can't set him free!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It isn't clothes,' said Hermione, 'although if I had my way I'd certainly give him something to wear other than that filthy old rag. No, it's a patchwork quilt, I thought it would brighten up his bedroom.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What bedroom?' said Harry, dropping his voice to a whisper as they were passing the portrait of Sirius's mother.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, Sirius says it's not so much a bedroom, more a kind of - 'den,' said Hermione. 'Apparently he sleeps under the boiler in that cupboard off the kitchen.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Mrs Weasley was the only person in the basement when they arrived there. She was standing at the stove and sounded as though she had a bad head cold as she wished them 'Merry Christmas', and they all averted their eyes.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'So, is this Kreacher's bedroom?' said Ron, strolling over to a dingy door in the corner opposite the pantry. Harry had never seen it open.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes,' said Hermione, now sounding a little nervous. 'Er . . . I think we'd better knock.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Ron rapped on the door with his knuckles but there was no reply.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'He must be sneaking around upstairs,' he said, and without further ado pulled open the door. 'Urgh!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry peered inside. Most of the cupboard was taken up with a very large and old-fashioned boiler, but in the foot of space underneath the pipes Kreacher had made himself something that looked like a nest. A jumble of assorted rags and smelly old blankets were piled on the floor and the small dent in the middle of it showed where Kreacher curled up to sleep every night. Here and there among the material were stale bread crusts and mouldy old bits of cheese. In a far corner glinted small objects and coins that Harry guessed Kreacher had saved, magpie-like, from Sirius's purge of the house, and he had also managed to retrieve the silver-framed family photographs that Sirius had thrown away over the summer. Their glass might be shattered, but still the little black-and-white people inside them peered up at him haughtily, including - he felt a little jolt in his stomach - the dark, heavy-lidded woman whose trial he had witnessed in Dumbledore's Pensieve: Bellatrix Lestrange. By the looks of it, hers was Kreachers favourite photograph; he had placed it to the fore of all the others and had mended the glass clumsily with Spellotape.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I think I'll just leave his present here,' said Hermione, laying the package neatly in the middle of the depression in the rags and blankets and closing the door quietly. 'He'll find it later, that'll be fine.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Come to think of it,' said Sirius, emerging from the pantry carrying a large turkey as they closed the cupboard door, 'has anyone actually seen Kreacher lately?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I haven't seen him since the night we came back here,' said Harry. 'You were ordering him out of the kitchen.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah . . .' said Sirius, frowning. 'You know, I think that's the last time I saw him, too . . . he must be hiding upstairs somewhere.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'He couldn't have left, could he?' said Harry. 'I mean, when you said \\\\\\\"out\\\\\\\", maybe he thought you meant get out of the house?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No, no, house-elves can't leave unless they're given clothes. They're tied to their family's house,' said Sirius.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They can leave the house if they really want to,' Harry contradicted him. 'Dobby did, he left the Malfoy's' to give me warnings two years ago. He had to punish himself afterwards, but he still managed it.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Sirius looked slightly disconcerted for a moment, then said, 'I'll look for him later, I expect I'll find him upstairs crying his eyes out over my mother's old bloomers or something. Of course, he might have crawled into the airing cupboard and died . . . but I mustn't get my hopes up.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Fred, George and Ron laughed; Hermione, however, looked reproachful.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Once they had eaten their Christmas lunch, the Weasleys, Harry a:id Hermione were planning to pay Mr Weasley another visit, escorted by Mad-Eye and Lupin. Mundungus turned up in time for Christmas pudding and trifle, having managed to 'borrow' a car for the occasion, as the Underground did not run on Christmas Day. The car, which Harry doubted very much had been taken with the consent of its owner, had been enlarged with a spell like the Weasleys' old Ford Anglia had once been. Although normally proportioned outside, ten people with Mundungus driving were able to fit into it quite comfortably. Mrs Weasley hesitated before getting inside - Harry knew her disapproval of Mundungus was battling with her dislike of travelling without magic - but, finally, the cold outside and her children's pleading triumphed, and she settled herself into the back seat between Fred and Bill with good grace.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The journey to St Mungo's was quite quick as there was very little traffic on the roads. A small trickle of witches and wizards was creeping furtively up the otherwise deserted street to visit the hospital. Harry and the others got out of the car, and Mundungus drove off around the corner to wait for them. They strolled casually towards the window where the dummy in green nylon stood, then, one by one, stepped through the glass.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The reception area looked pleasantly festive: the crystal orbs that illuminated St Mungo's had been coloured red and gold to become gigantic, glowing Christmas baubles; holly hung around every doorway; and shining white Christmas trees covered in magical snow and icicles glittered in every corner, each one topped with a gleaming gold star. It was less crowded than the last time they had been there, although halfway across the room Harry found himself shunted aside by a witch with a satsuma jammed up her left nostril.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Family argument, eh?' smirked the blonde witch behind the desk. 'You're the third I've seen today . . . Spell Damage, fourth floor.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They found Mr Weasley propped up in bed with the remains of his turkey dinner on a tray on his lap and a rather sheepish expression on his face.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Everything all right, Arthur?' asked Mrs Weasley, after they had all greeted Mr Weasley and handed over their presents.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Fine, fine,' said Mr Weasley, a little too heartily. 'You - er - 'haven't seen Healer Smethwyck, have you?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No,' said Mrs Weasley suspiciously, 'why?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Nothing, nothing,' said Mr Weasley airily, starting to unwrap his pile of gifts. 'Well, everyone had a good day? What did you all get for Christmas? Oh, Harry - this is absolutely wonderful!' For he had just opened Harry's gift of fuse-wire and screwdrivers.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Mrs Weasley did not seem entirely satisfied with Mr Weasley's answer. As her husband leaned over to shake Harry's hand, she peered at the bandaging under his nightshirt.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Arthur,' she said, with a snap in her voice like a mousetrap, 'you've had your bandages changed. Why have you had your bandages changed a day early, Arthur? They told me they wouldn't need doing until tomorrow.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What?' said Mr Weasley, looking rather frightened and pulling the bed covers higher up his chest. 'No, no - it's nothing - it's - 'I - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He seemed to deflate under Mrs Weasley's piercing gaze.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Well - now don't get upset, Molly, but Augustus Pye had an idea . . . he's the Trainee Healer, you know, lovely young chap and very interested in . . . um . . . complementary medicine . . . I mean, some of these old Muggle remedies . . . well, they're called stitches, Molly, and they work very well on - on Muggle wounds - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Mrs Weasley let out an ominous noise somewhere between a shriek and a snarl. Lupin strolled away from the bed and over to the werewolf, who had no visitors and was looking rather wistfully at the crowd around Mr Weasley; Bill muttered something s.bout getting himself a cup of tea and Fred and George leapt up to accompany him, grinning.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Do you mean to tell me,' said Mrs Weasley, her voice growing louder with every word and apparently unaware that her fellow visitors were scurrying for cover, 'that you have been messing about with Muggle remedies?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Not messing about, Molly, dear,' said Mr Weasley imploringly, 'it was just - just something Pye and I thought we'd try - only, most unfortunately - well, with these particular kinds of wounds - it doesn't seem to work as well as we'd hoped - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Meaning?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well . . . well, I don't know whether you know what - what stitches are?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It sounds as though you've been trying to sew your skin back together,' said Mrs Weasley with a snort of mirthless laughter, 'but even you, Arthur, wouldn't be that stupid - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I fancy a cup of tea, too,' said Harry, jumping to his feet.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hermione, Ron and Ginny almost sprinted to the door with him. As it swung closed behind them, they heard Mrs Weasley shriek, 'WHAT DO YOU MEAN, THAT'S THE GENERAL IDEA?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Typical Dad,' said Ginny, shaking her head as they set off up the corridor. 'Stitches . . . I ask you . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, you know, they do work well on non-magical wounds,' said Hermione fairly. 'I suppose something in that snake's venom dissolves them or something. I wonder where the tearoom is?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Fifth floor,' said Harry, remembering the sign over the welcomewitch's desk.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They walked along the corridor, through a set of double doors and found a rickety staircase lined with more portraits of brutal-looking Healers. As they climbed it, the various Healers called out to them, diagnosing odd complaints and suggesting horrible remedies. Ron was seriously affronted when a medieval wizard called out that he clearly had a bad case of spattergroit.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And what's that supposed to be?' he asked angrily, as the Healer pursued him through six more portraits, shoving the occupants out of the way.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 ' 'Tis a most grievous affliction of the skin, young master, that will leave you pockmarked and more gruesome even than you are now - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Watch who you're calling gruesome!' said Ron, his ears turning red.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 ' - the only remedy is to take the liver of a toad, bind it tight about your throat, stand naked at the full moon in a barrel of eels' eyes - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I have not got spattergroit!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'But the unsightly blemishes upon your visage, young master - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'They're freckles!' said Ron furiously. 'Now get back in your own picture and leave me alone!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He rounded on the others, who were all keeping determinedly straight faces.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What floor's this?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I think it's the fifth,' said Hermione.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Nah, it's the fourth,' said Harry, 'one more -\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But as he stepped on to the landing he came to an abrupt halt, staring at the small window set into the double doors that marked the start of a corridor signposted SPELL DAMAGE. A man was peering out at them all with his nose pressed against the glass. He had wavy blond hair, bright blue eyes and a broad vacant smile that revealed dazzlingly white teeth.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Blimey!' said Ron, also staring at the man.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, my goodness,' said Hermione suddenly, sounding breathless. 'Professor Lockhart.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Their ex-Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher pushed open the doors and moved towards them, wearing a long lilac dressing gown.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, hello there!' he said. 'I expect you'd like my autograph, would you?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Hasn't changed much, has he?' Harry muttered to Ginny, who grinned.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Er - how are you, Professor?' said Ron, sounding slightly guilty. It had been Ron's malfunctioning wand that had damaged Professor Lockhart's memory so badly that he had landed in St Mungo's in the first place, though as Lockhart had been attempting to permanently wipe Harry and Ron's memories at the time, Harry's sympathy was limited.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'm very well indeed, thank you!' said Lockhart exuberantly, palling a rather battered peacock-feather quill from his pocket. 'Mow, how many autographs would you like? I can do joined-up writing now, you know!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Er - we don't want any at the moment, thanks,' said Ron, raising his eyebrows at Harry, who asked, 'Professor, should you be wandering around the corridors? Shouldn't you be in a ward?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The smile faded slowly from Lockhart's face. For a few moments he gazed intently at Harry, then he said, 'Haven't we met?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Er . . . yeah, we have,' said Harry. 'You used to teach us at Hogwarts, remember?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Teach?' repeated Lockhart, looking faintly unsettled. 'Me? Did I?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 And then the smile reappeared upon his face so suddenly it was rather alarming.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Taught you everything you know, I expect, did I? Well, how about those autographs, then? Shall we say a round dozen, you can give them to all your little friends then and nobody will be left out!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But just then a head poked out of a door at the far end of the corridor and a voice called, 'Gilderoy, you naughty boy, where have you wandered off to?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 A motherly-looking Healer wearing a tinsel wreath in her hair came bustling up the corridor, smiling warmly at Harry and the others.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, Gilderoy, you've got visitors! How lovely, and on Christmas Day, too! Do you know, he never gets visitors, poor lamb, and I can't think why, he's such a sweetie, aren't you?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'We're doing autographs!' Gilderoy told the Healer with another glittering smile. They want loads of them, won't take no for an answer! I just hope we've got enough photographs!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Listen to him,' said the Healer, taking Lockhart's arm and beaming fondly at him as though he were a precocious two-year-old. 'He was rather well known a few years ago; we very much hope that this liking for giving autographs is a sign that his memory might be starting to come back. Will you step this way? He's in a closed ward, you know, he must have slipped out while I was bringing in the Christmas presents, the door's usually kept locked . . . not that he's dangerous! But,' she lowered her voice to a whisper, 'he's a bit of a danger to himself, bless him . . . doesn't know who he is, you see, wanders off and can't remember how to get back . . . it is nice of you to have come to see him.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Er,' said Ron, gesturing uselessly at the floor above, 'actually, we were just - er -'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But the Healer was smiling expectantly at them, and Ron's feeble mutter of 'going to have a cup of tea' trailed away into nothingness. They looked at each other helplessly, then followed Lockhart and his Healer along the corridor.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Let's not stay long,' Ron said quietly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The Healer pointed her wand at the door of the Janus Thickey Ward and muttered, 'Alohomora.' The door swung open and she led the way inside, keeping a firm grasp on Gilderoy's arm until she had settled him into an armchair beside his bed.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 This is our long-term residents' ward,' she informed Harry, Ron,\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hermione and Ginny in a low voice. 'For permanent spell damage, you know. Of course, with intensive remedial potions and charms and a bit of luck, we can produce some improvement. Gilderoy does seem to be getting back some sense of himself; and we've seen a real improvement in Mr Bode, he seems to be regaining the power of speech very well, though he isn't speaking any language w: recognise yet. Well, I must finish giving out the Christmas presents, I'll leave you all to chat.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry looked around. The ward bore unmistakeable signs of being a permanent home to its residents. They had many more personal effects around their beds than in Mr Weasley's ward; the wall around Gilderoy's headboard, for instance, was papered with pictures of himself, all beaming toothily and waving at the new arrivals. He had autographed many of them to himself in disjointed, childish writing. The moment he had been deposited in his chair b> the Healer, Gilderoy pulled a fresh stack of photographs towards him, seized a quill and started signing them all feverishly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You can put them in envelopes,' he said to Ginny, throwing the signed pictures into her lap one by one as he finished them. 'I am not forgotten, you know, no, I still receive a very great deal of fan mail . . . Gladys Gudgeon writes weekly . . . I just wish I knew why . . .' He paused, looking faintly puzzled, then beamed again and returned to his signing with renewed vigour. 'I suspect it is simply my good looks . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 A sallow-skinned, mournful-looking wizard lay in the bed opposite staring at the ceiling; he was mumbling to himself and seemed quite unaware of anything around him. Two beds along was a woman whose entire head was covered in fur; Harry remembered something similar happening to Hermione during their second year, although fortunately the damage, in her case, had not been permanent. At the far end of the ward flowery curtains had been drawn around two beds to give the occupants and their visitors some privacy.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Here you are, Agnes,' said the Healer brightly to the furry-faced woman, handing her a small pile of Christmas presents. 'See, not forgotten, are you? And your son's sent an owl to say he's visiting tonight, so that's nice, isn't it?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Agnes gave several loud barks.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And look, Broderick, you've been sent a pot plant and a lovely calendar with a different fancy Hippogriff for each month; they'll brighten things up, won't they?' said the Healer, bustling along to the mumbling man, setting a rather ugly plant with long, swaying tentacles on the bedside cabinet and fixing the calendar to the wall with her wand. 'And - oh, Mrs Longbottom, are you leaving already?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry's head span round. The curtains had been drawn back from the two beds at the end of the ward and two visitors were walking back down the aisle between the beds: a formidable-looking old witch wearing a long green dress, a moth-eaten fox fur and a pointed hat decorated with what was unmistakeably a stuffed vulture and, trailing behind her looking thoroughly depressed - Neville.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 With a sudden rush of understanding, Harry realised who the people in the end beds must be. He cast around wildly for some means of distracting the others so that Neville could leave the ward unnoticed and unquestioned, but Ron had also looked up at the sound of the name 'Longbottom', and before Harry could stop him had called out, 'Neville!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Neville jumped and cowered as though a bullet had narrowly missed him.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It's us, Neville!' said Ron brightly, getting to his feet. 'Have you seen - '? Lockhart's here! Who've you been visiting?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Friends of yours, Neville, dear?' said Neville's grandmother graciously, bearing down upon them all.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Neville looked as though he would rather be anywhere in the world but here. A dull purple flush was creeping up his plump face and he was not making eye contact with any of them.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Ah, yes,' said his grandmother, looking closely at Harry and sticking out a shrivelled, clawlike hand for him to shake. 'Yes, yes, I know who you are, of course. Neville speaks most highly of you.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Er - thanks,' said Harry, shaking hands. Neville did not look at him, but surveyed his own feet, the colour deepening in his face all the while.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And you two are clearly Weasleys,' Mrs Longbottom continued, proffering her hand regally to Ron and Ginny in turn. 'Yes, I know your parents - not well, of course - but fine people, fine people . . . and you must be Hermione Granger?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hermione looked rather startled that Mrs Longbottom knew her name, but shook hands all the same.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes, Neville's told me all about you. Helped him out of a few sticky spots, haven't you? He's a good boy,' she said, casting a sternly appraising look down her rather bony nose at Neville, 'but be hasn't got his father's talent, I'm afraid to say.' And she jerked her head in the direction of the two beds at the end of the ward, so that the stuffed vulture on her hat trembled alarmingly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What?' said Ron, looking amazed. (Harry wanted to stamp on Ron's foot, but that sort of thing is much harder to bring off unnoticed when you're wearing jeans rather than robes.) 'Is that your dad down the end, Neville?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What's this?' said Mrs Longbottom sharply. 'Haven't you told your friends about your parents, Neville?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Neville took a deep breath, looked up at the ceiling and shook his head. Harry could not remember ever feeling sorrier for anyone, but he could not think of any way of helping Neville out of the situation.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Well, it's nothing to be ashamed of!' said Mrs Longbottom angrily. 'You should be proud, Neville, proud! They didn't give their health and their sanity so their only son would be ashamed of them, you know!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'm not ashamed,' said Neville, very faintly, still looking anywhere but at Harry and the others. Ron was now standing on tiptoe to look over at the inhabitants of the two beds.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Well, you've got a funny way of showing it!' said Mrs Longbottom. 'My son and his wife,' she said, turning haughtily to Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny, 'were tortured into insanity by You-Know-Who's followers.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hermione and Ginny both clapped their hands over their mouths. Ron stopped craning his neck to catch a glimpse of Neville's parents and looked mortified.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They were Aurors, you know, and very well respected within the wizarding community,' Mrs Longbottom went on. 'Highly gifted, the pair of them. I - yes, Alice dear, what is it?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Neville's mother had come edging down the ward in her nightdress. She no longer had the plump, happy-looking face Harry had seen in Moody's old photograph of the original Order of the Phoenix. Her face was thin and worn now, her eyes seemed overlarge and her hair, which had turned white, was wispy and dead-looking. She did not seem to want to speak, or perhaps she was not able to, but she made timid motions towards Neville, holding something in her outstretched hand.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Again?' said Mrs Longbottom, sounding slightly weary. 'Very well, Alice dear, very well - Neville, take it, whatever it is.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But Neville had already stretched out his hand, into which his mother dropped an empty Drooble's Best Blowing Gum wrapper.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Very nice, dear,' said Neville's grandmother in a falsely cheery voice, patting his mother on the shoulder.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But Neville said quietly, Thanks, Mum.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 His mother tottered away, back up the ward, humming to herself. Neville looked around at the others, his expression defiant, as though daring them to laugh, but Harry did not think he'd ever found anything less funny in his life.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, we'd better get back,' sighed Mrs Longbottom, drawing on long green gloves. 'Very nice to have met you all. Neville, put that wrapper in the bin, she must have given you enough of them to paper your bedroom by now.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But as they left, Harry was sure he saw Neville slip the sweet wrapper into his pocket.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The door closed behind them.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I never knew,' said Hermione, who looked tearful.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Nor did I,' said Ron rather hoarsely.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Nor me,' whispered Ginny.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They all looked at Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I did,' he said glumly. 'Dumbledore told me but I promised I wouldn't tell anyone . . . that's what Bellatrix Lestrange got sent to Azkaban for, using the Cruciatus Curse on Neville's parents until they lost their minds.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Bellatrix Lestrange did that?' whispered Hermione, horrified. That woman Kreacher's got a photo of in his den?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 There was a long silence, broken by Lockhart's angry voice.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Look, I didn't learn joined-up writing for nothing, you know!'\\\"\",\n          \"When Harry woke the following day it was several seconds before he remembered what had happened. Then he hoped childishly, that it had been a dream, that Ron was still there and had never left. Yet by turning his head on his pillow he could see Ron's deserted bunk. It was like a dead body in the way it seems to draw his eyes. Harry jumped down from his own bed, keeping his eyes averted from Ron's. Hermione, who was already busy in the kitchen, did not wish Harry good morning, but turned her face away quickly as he went by. He's gone, Harry told himself. He's gone. He had to keep thinking it as he washed and dressed as though repetition would dull the shock of it. He's gone and he's not coming back. And that was the simple truth of it, Harry knew, because their protective enchantments meant that it would be impossible, once they vacated this spot, for Ron to find them again. He and Hermione ate breakfast in silence. Hermione's eyes were puffy and red; she looked as if she had not slept. They packed up their things, Hermione dawdling. Harry knew why she wanted to spin out their time on the riverbank; several times he saw her look up eagerly, and he was sure she had deluded herself into thinking that she heard footsteps through the heavy rain, but no red-haired figure appeared between the trees. Every time Harry imitated her, looked around ( for he could not help hoping a little, himself) and saw nothing but rain-swept woods, another little parcel of fury exploded inside him. He could hear Ron saying, \\\\We thought you knew what you were doing!\\\\\\\", and he resumed packing with a hard knot in the pit of his stomach.The muddy river beside them was rising rapidly and would soon spill over onto their bank. They had lingered a good hour after they would usually have departed their campsite. Finally having entirely repacked the beaded bag three times, Hermione seemed unable to find any more reasons to delay: She and Harry grasped hands and Disapparated, reappearing on a windswept heather-covered hillside. The instant they arrived, Hermione dropped Harry's hand and walked away from him, finally sitting down on a large rock, her face on her knees, shaking with what he knew were sobs. He watched her, supposing that he ought to go and comfort her, but something kept him rooted to the spot. Everything inside him felt cold and tight: Again he saw the contemptuous expression on Ron's face. Harry strode off through the heather, walking in a large circle with the distraught Hermione at its center, casting the spell she usually performed to ensure their protection.They did not discuss Ron at all over the next few days. Harry was determined never to mention his name again and Hermione seemed to know that it was no use forcing the issue, although sometimes at night when she thought he was sleeping, he would hear her crying. Meanwhile Harry had started bringing out the Marauder's map and examining it by wandlight. He was waiting for the moment when Ron's labeled dot would reappear in the corridors of Hogwarts, proving that he had returned to the comfortable castle, protected by his status of pureblood. However, Ron did not appear on the map and after a while Harry found himself taking it out simply to stare at Ginny's name in the girl's dormitory, wondering whether the intensity with which he gazed at it might break into her sleep, that she would somehow know he was thinking about her, hoping that she was all right.By day, they devoted themselves to trying to determine the possible locations of Gryffindor's sword, but the more they talked about the places in which Dumbledore might have hidden it, the more desperate and far-fetched their speculation became. Cudgel his brains though he might, Harry could not remember Dumbledore ever mentioning a place in which he might hide something. There were moments when he did not know whether he was angrier with Ron or with Dumbledore. We thought you knew what you were doing...We thought Dumbledore had told you what to do... We thought you had a real plan!He could not hide it from himself: Ron had been right. Dumbledore had left him with virtually nothing. They had discovered one Horcrux, but they had no means of destroying it: The others were as unattainable as they had ever been. Hopelessness threatened to engulf him. He was staggered now to think of his own presumption in accepting his friends' offers to accompany him on this meandering, pointless journey. he knew nothing, he had no ideas, and he was constantly, painfully on the alert for any indications that Hermione too was about to tell him that she had had enough. That she was leaving.They were spending many evenings in near silence and Hermione took to bringing out Phineas Nigellus's portrait and propping it up in a chair, as though he might fill part of the gaping hole left by Ron's departure. Despite his previous assertion that he would never visit them again, Phineas Nigellus did not seem able to resist the chance to find out more about what Harry was up to and consented to reappear, blindfolded, every few days of so. Harry was even glad to see him, because he was company, albeit of a snide and taunting kind. They relished any news about what was happening at Hogwarts, though Phineas Nigellus was not an ideal informer. He venerated Snape, the first Slytherin headmaster since he himself had controlled the school, and they had to be careful not to criticize or ask impertinent questions about Snape, or Phineas Nigellus would instantly leave his painting.However, he did let drop certain snippets. Snape seemed to be facing a constant, low level of mutiny from a hard core of students. Ginny had been banned from going into Hogsmeade. Snape had reinstated Umbridge's old decree forbidding gatherings of three or more students or any unofficial student societies. From all of these things, Harry deduced that Ginny, and probably Neville and Luna along with her, had been doing their best to continue Dumbledore's Army. This scant news made Harry want to see Ginny so badly it felt like a stomachache; but it also made him think of Ron again, and of Dumbledore, and of Hogwarts itself, which he missed nearly as much as his ex-girlfriend. Indeed, as Phineas Niggellus talked about Snape's crackdown, Harry experienced a split second of madness when he imagined simply going back to school to join the destabilization of Snape's regime: Being fed and having a soft bad, and other people being in charge, seemed the most wonderful prospect in the world at this moment. But then he remembered that he was Undesirable Number One, that there was a ten-thousand Galleon price on his head, and that to walk into Hogwarts these days was just as dangerous as walking into the Ministry of Magic. Indeed, Phineas Nigellus inadvertently emphasized this fact by slipping in leading questions about Harry and Hermione's whereabouts. Hermione shoved him back inside the beaded bag every time he did this, and Phineas Nigellus invariably refused to reappear for several days after these unceremonious good-byes.The weather grew colder and colder. They did not dare remain in any area too long, so rather than staying in the south of England, where a hard ground frost was the worst of their worries, they continued to meander up and down the country, braving a mountainside, where sleet pounded the tent; a wide, flat marsh, where the tent was flooded with chill water; and a tiny island in the middle of a Scottish loch, where snow half buried the tent in the night. They had already spotted Christmas Trees twinkling from several sitting room windows before there came an evening when Harry resolved to suggest again, what seemed to him the only unexplored avenue left to them. They had just eaten an unusually good meal: Hermione had been to a supermarket under the Invisibility Cloak (scrupulously dropping the money into an open till as she left), and Harry thought that she might be more persuadable than usual on a stomach full of spaghetti Bolognese and tinned pears.He had also had the foresight to suggest that they take a few hours' break from wearing the Horcrux, which was hanging over the end of the bunk beside him.\\\\\\\"Hermione?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Hmm?\\\\\\\" She was curled up in one of the sagging armchairs with The Tales of Beedle the Bard. He could not imagine how much more she could get out of the book, which was not, after all, very long, but evidently she was still deciphering something in it, because Spellman's Syllabary lay open on the arm of the chair.Harry cleared his throat. He felt exactly as he had done on the occasion, several years previously, when he had asked Professor McGonagall whether he could go into Hogsmeade, despite the fact that he had not persuaded the Dursleys to sign his permission slip.\\\\\\\"Hermione, I've been thinking, and \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Harry, could you help me with something?\\\\\\\"Apparently she had not been listening to him. She leaned forward and held out The Tales of Beedle the Bard.\\\\\\\"Look at that symbol,\\\\\\\" she said, pointing to the top of a page. Above what Harry assumed was the title of the story (being unable to read runes, he could not be sure), there was a picture of what looked like a triangular eye, its pupil crossed with a vertical line.\\\\\\\"I never took Ancient Runes, Hermione.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I know that; but it isn't a rune and it's not in the syllabary, either. All along I thought it was a picture of an eye, but I don't think it is! It's been inked in, look, somebody's drawn it there, it isn't really part of the book. Think, have you ever seen it before?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"No... No, wait a moment.\\\\\\\" Harry looked closer. \\\\\\\"Isn't it the same symbol Luna's dad was wearing round his neck?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Well, that's what I thought too!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Then it's Grindelwald's mark.\\\\\\\"She stared at him, openmouthed.\\\\\\\"What?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Krum told me...\\\\\\\"He recounted the story that Viktor Krum had told him at the wedding. Hermione looked astonished.\\\\\\\"Grindelwald's mark?\\\\\\\"She looked from Harry to the weird symbol and back again. \\\\\\\"I've never heard that Grindelwald had a mark. There's no mention of it in anything I've ever read about him.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Well, like I say, Krum reckoned that symbol was carved on a wall at Durmstrang, and Grindelwald put it there.\\\\\\\"She fell back into the old armchair, frowning.\\\\\\\"That's very odd. If it's a symbol of Dark Magic, what's it doing in a book of children's stories?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Yeah, it is weird,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"And you'd think Scrimgeour would have recognized it. He was Minister, he ought to have been expert on Dark stuff.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I know.... Perhaps he thought it was an eye, just like I did. All the other stories have little pictures over the titles.\\\\\\\"She did not speak, but continued to pore over the strange mark. Harry tried again.\\\\\\\"Hermione?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Hmm?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I've been thinking. I \\u00a8C I want to go to Godric's Hollow.\\\\\\\"She looked up at him, but her eyes were unfocused, and he was sure she was still thinking about the mysterious mark on the book.\\\\\\\"Yes,\\\\\\\" she said. \\\\\\\"Yes, I've been wondering that too. I really think we'll have to.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Did you hear me right?\\\\\\\" he asked.\\\\\\\"Of course I did. You want to go to Godric's Hollow. I agree. I think we should. I mean, I can't think of anywhere else it could be either. It'll be dangerous, but the more I think about it, the more likely it seems it's there.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Er \\u00a8C what's there?\\\\\\\" asked Harry.At that, she looked just as bewildered as he felt.\\\\\\\"Well, the sword, Harry! Dumbledore must have known you'd want to go back there, and I mean, Godric's Hollow is Godric Gryffindor's birthplace \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Really? Gryffindor came from Godric's Hollow?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Harry, did you ever even open A History of Magic?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Erm,\\\\\\\" he said, smiling for what felt like the first time in months: The muscles in his face felt oddly stiff. \\\\\\\"I might've opened it, you know, when I bought it... just the once....\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Well, as the village is named after him I'd have thought you might have made the connection,\\\\\\\" said Hermione. She sounded much more like her old self than she had done of late; Harry half expected her to announce that she was off to the library. \\\\\\\"There's a bit about the village in A History of Magic, wait...\\\\\\\"She opened the beaded bag and rummaged for a while, finally extracting her copy of their old school textbook, A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot, which she thumbed through until finding the page she wanted.\\\\\\\"'Upon the signature of the International Statute of Secrecy in 1689, wizards went into hiding for good. It was natural, perhaps, that they formed their own small communities within a community. Many small villages and hamlets attracted several magical families, who banded together for mutual support and protection. The villages of Tinworsh in Cornwall, Upper Flagley in Yorkshire, and Ottery St. Catchpole on the south coast of England were notable homes to knots of Wizarding families who lived alongside tolerant and sometimes Confunded Muggles. Most celebrated of these half-magical dwelling places is, perhaps, Godric's Hollow, the West Country village where the great wizard Godric Gryffindor was born, and where Bowman Wright, Wizarding smith, forged the first Golden Snitch. The graveyard is full of the names of ancient magical families, and this accounts, no doubt, for the stories of hauntings that have dogged the little church beside it for many centuries.'\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"You and your parents aren't mentioned.\\\\\\\" Hermione said, closing the book, \\\\\\\"because Professor Bagshot doesn't cover anything later than the end of the nineteenth century. But you see? Godric's Hollow, Godric Gryffindor, Gryffindor's sword; don't you think Dumbledore would have expected you to make the connection?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Oh yeah...\\\\\\\"Harry did not want to admit that he had not been thinking about the sword at all when he suggested they go to Godric's Hollow. For him, the lore of the village lay in his parents' graves, the house where he had narrowly escaped death, and in the person of Bathilda Bagshot.\\\\\\\"Remember what Muriel said?\\\\\\\" he asked eventually.\\\\\\\"Who?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"You know,\\\\\\\" he hesitated. He did not want to say Ron's name. \\\\\\\"Ginny's great-aunt. At the wedding. The one who said you had skinny ankles.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Oh,\\\\\\\" said Hermione. It was a sticky moment: Harry knew that she had sensed Ron's name in the offing. He rushed on:\\\\\\\"She said Bathilda Bagshot still lived in Godric's Hollow.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Bathilda Bagshot,\\\\\\\" murmured Hermione, running her index finger over Bathilda's embossed name on the front cover of A History of Magic. \\\\\\\"Well, I suppose \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"She gasped so dramatically that Harry's insides turned over; he drew his wand, looking around at the entrance, half expecting to see a hand forcing its way through the entrance flap, but there was nothing there.\\\\\\\"What?\\\\\\\" he said, half angry, half relieved. \\\\\\\"What did you do that for? I thought you'd seen a Death Eater unzipping the tent, at least \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Harry, what if Bathilda's got the sword? What if Dumbledore entrusted it to her?\\\\\\\"Harry considered this possibility. Bathilda would be an extremely old woman by now, and according to Muriel, she was \\\\\\\"gaga.\\\\\\\" Was it likely that Dumbledore would have hidden the sword of Gryffindor with her? If so, Harry felt that Dumbledore had left a great deal to chance: Dumbledore had never revealed that he had replaced the sword with a fake, nor had he so much as mentioned a friendship with Bathilda. Now, however, was not the moment to cast doubt on Hermione's theory, not when she was so surprisingly willing to fall in with Harry's dearest wish.\\\\\\\"Yeah, he might have done! So, are we going to go to Godric's Hollow?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Yes, but we'll have to think it through carefully, Harry.\\\\\\\" She was sitting up now, and Harry could tell that the prospect of having a plan again had lifted her mood as much as his. \\\\\\\"We'll need to practice Disapparating together under the Invisibility Cloak for a start, and perhaps Disillusionment Charms would be sensible too, unless you think we should go the whole hog and use Polyjuice Potion? In that case we'll need to collect hair from somebody. I actually think we'd better do that, Harry, the thicker our disguises the better....\\\\\\\"Harry let her talk, nodding and agreeing whenever there was a pause, but his mind had left the conversation. For the first time since he had discovered that the sword in Gringotts was a fake, he felt excited.He was about to go home, about to return to the place where he had had a family. It was in Godric's Hollow that, but for Voldemort, he would have grown up and spent every school holiday. He could have invited friends to his house.... He might even have had brothers and sisters.... It would have been his mother who had made his seventeenth birthday cake. The life he had lost had hardly ever seemed so real to him as at this moment, when he knew he was about to see the place where it had been taken from him. After Hermione had gone to bed that night, Harry quietly extracted his rucksack from Hermione's beaded bag, and from inside it, the photograph album Hagrid had given him so long ago. For the first time in months, he perused the old pictures of his parents, smiling and waving up at him from the images, which were all he had left of them now.Harry would gladly have set out for Godric's Hollow the following day, but Hermione had other ideas. Convinced as she was that Voldemort would expect Harry to return to the scene of his parents' deaths, she was determined that they would set off only after they had ensured that they had the best disguises possible. It was therefore a full week later \\u00a8C once they had surreptitiously obtained hairs from innocent Muggles who were Christmas shopping, and had practiced Apparating and Disapparating while underneath the Invisibility Cloak together \\u00a8C that Hermione agreed to make the journey.They were to Apparate to the village under cover of darkness, so it was late afternoon when they finally swallowed Polyjuice Potion, Harry transforming into a balding, middle-aged Muggle man, Hermione into his small and rather mousy wife. The beaded bag containing all of their possessions (apart from the Horcrux, which Harry was wearing around his neck) was tucked into an inside pocket of Hermione's buttoned-up coat. Harry lowered the Invisibility Cloak over them, then they turned into the suffocating darkness once again.Heart beating in his throat, Harry opened his eyes. They were standing hand in hand in a snowy lane under a dark blue sky, in which the night's first stars were already glimmering feebly. Cottages stood on either side of the narrow road, Christmas decorations twinkling in their windows. A short way ahead of them, a glow of golden streetlights indicated the center of the village.\\\\\\\"All this snow!\\\\\\\" Hermione whispered beneath the cloak. \\\\\\\"Why didn't we think of snow? After all our precautions, we'll leave prints! We'll just have to get rid of them \\u00a8C you go in front, I'll do it \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"Harry did not want to enter the village like a pantomime horse, trying to keep themselves concealed while magically covering their traces.\\\\\\\"Let's take off the Cloak,\\\\\\\" said Harry, and when she looked frightened, \\\\\\\"Oh, come on, we don't look like us and there's no one around.\\\\\\\"He stowed the Cloak under his jacket and they made their way forward unhampered, the icy air stinging their faces as they passed more cottages. Any one of them might have been the one in which James and Lily had once lived or where Bathilda lived now. Harry gazed at the front doors, their snow-burdened roofs, and their front porches, wondering whether he remembered any of them, knowing deep inside that it was impossible, that he had been little more than a year old when he had left this place forever. He was not even sure whether he would be able to see the cottage at all; he did not know what happened when the subjects of a Fidelius Charm died. Then the little lane along which they were walking curved to the left and the heart of the village, a small square, was revealed to them.Strung all around with colored lights, there was what looked like a war memorial in the middle, partly obscured by a windblown Christmas tree. There were several shops, a post office, a pub, and a little church whose stained-glass windows were glowing jewel-bright across the square.The snow here had become impacted: It was hard and slippery where people had trodden on it all day. Villagers were crisscrossing in front of them, their figures briefly illuminated by streetlamps. They heard a snatch of laughter and pop music as the pub door opened and closed; then they heard a carol start up inside the little church.\\\\\\\"Harry, I think it's Christmas Eve!\\\\\\\" said Hermione.\\\\\\\"Is it?\\\\\\\"He had lost track of the date; they had not seen a newspaper for weeks.\\\\\\\"I'm sure it is,\\\\\\\" said Hermione, her eyes upon the church. \\\\\\\"They... they'll be in there, won't they? Your mum and dad? I can see the graveyard behind it.\\\\\\\"Harry felt a thrill of something that was beyond excitement, more like fear. Now that he was so near, he wondered whether he wanted to see after all. Perhaps Hermione knew how he was feeling, because she reached for his hand and took the lead for the first time, pulling him forward. Halfway across the square, however, she stopped dead.\\\\\\\"Harry, look!\\\\\\\"She was pointing at the war memorial. As they had passed it, it had transformed. Instead of an obelisk covered in names, there was a statue of three people: a man with untidy hair and glasses, a woman with long hair and a kind, pretty face, and a baby boy sitting in his mother's arms. Snow lay upon all their heads, like fluffy white caps.Harry drew closer, gazing up into his parents' faces. He had never imagined that there would be a statue.... How strange it was to see himself represented in stone, a happy baby without a scar on his forehead....\\\\\\\"C'mon,\\\\\\\" said Harry, when he had looked his fill, and they turned again toward the church. As they crossed the road, he glanced over his shoulder; the statue had turned back into the war memorial.The singing grew louder as they approached the church. It made Harry's throat constrict, it reminded him so forcefully of Hogwarts, of Peeves bellowing rude versions of carols from inside suits of armor, of the Great Hall's twelve Christmas trees, of Dumbledore wearing a bonnet he had won in a cracker, of Ron in a hand-knitted sweater....There was a kissing gate at the entrance to the graveyard. Hermione pushed it open as quietly as possible and they edged through it. On either side of the slippery path to the church doors, the snow lay deep and untouched. They moved off through the snow, carving deep trenches behind them as they walked around the building, keeping to the shadows beneath the brilliant windows.Behind the church, row upon row of snowy tombstones protruded from a blanket of pale blue that was flecked with dazzling red, gold, and green wherever the reflections from the stained glass hit the snow. Keeping his hand closed tightly on the wand in his jacket pocket, Harry moved toward the nearest grave.\\\\\\\"Look at this, it's an Abbott, could be some long-lost relation of Hannah's!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Keep your voice down,\\\\\\\" Hermione begged him.They waded deeper and deeper into the graveyard, gouging dark tracks into the snow behind them, stooping to peer at the words on old headstones, every now and then squinting into the surrounding darkness to make absolutely sure that they were unaccompanied.\\\\\\\"Harry, here!\\\\\\\"Hermione was two rows of tombstones away; he had to wade back to her, his heart positively banging in his chest.\\\\\\\"Is it \\u00a8C?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"No, but look!\\\\\\\"She pointed to the dark stone. Harry stooped down and saw, upon the frozen, lichen-spotted granite, the words Kendra Dumbledore and, a short way down her dates of birth and death, and Her Daughter Ariana. There was also a quotation:Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.So Rita Skeeter and Muriel had got some of their facts right. The Dumbledore family had indeed lived here, and part of it had died here.Seeing the grave was worse than hearing about it. Harry could not help thinking that he and Dumbledore both had deep roots in this graveyard, and that Dumbledore ought to have told him so, yet he had never thought to share the connection. They could have visited the place together; for a moment Harry imagined coming here with Dumbledore, of what a bond that would have been, of how much it would have meant to him. But it seemed that to Dumbledore, the fact that their families lay side by side in the same graveyard had been an unimportant coincidence, irrelevant, perhaps, to the job he wanted Harry to do.Hermione was looking at Harry, and he was glad that his face was hidden in shadow. He read the words on the tombstone again. Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. He did not understand what these words meant. Surely Dumbledore had chosen them, as the eldest member of the family once his mother had died.\\\\\\\"Are you sure he never mentioned \\u00a8C?\\\\\\\" Hermione began.\\\\\\\"No,\\\\\\\" said Harry curtly, then, \\\\\\\"let's keep looking,\\\\\\\" and he turned away, wishing he had not seen the stone: He did not want his excited trepidation tainted with resentment.\\\\\\\"Here!\\\\\\\" cried Hermione again a few moments later from out of the darkness. \\\\\\\"Oh no, sorry! I thought it said Potter.\\\\\\\"She was rubbing at a crumbling, mossy stone, gazing down at it, a little frown on her face.\\\\\\\"Harry, come back a moment.\\\\\\\"He did not want to be sidetracked again, and only grudgingly made his way back through the snow toward her.\\\\\\\"What?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Look at this!\\\\\\\"The grave was extremely old, weathered so that Harry could hardly make out the name. Hermione showed him the symbol beneath it.\\\\\\\"Harry, that's the mark in the book!\\\\\\\"He peered at the place she indicated: The stone was so worn that it was hard to make out what was engraved there, though there did seem to be a triangular mark beneath the nearly illegible name.\\\\\\\"Yeah... it could be....\\\\\\\"Hermione lit her wand and pointed it at the name on the headstone.\\\\\\\"It says Ig \\u00a8C Ignotus, I think....\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I'm going to keep looking for my parents, all right?\\\\\\\" Harry told her, a slight edge to his voice, and he set off again, leaving her crouched beside the old grave.Every now and then he recognized a surname that, like Abbott, he had met at Hogwarts. Sometimes there were several generations of the same Wizarding family represented in the graveyard: Harry could tell from the dates that it had either died out, or the current members had moved away from Godric's Hollow. Deeper and deeper amongst the graves he went, and every time he reached a new headstone he felt a little lurch of apprehension and anticipation.The darkness and the silence seemed to become, all of a sudden, much deeper. Harry looked around, worried, thinking of dementors, then realized that the carols had finished, that the chatter and flurry of churchgoers were fading away as they made their way back into the square. Somebody inside the church had just turned off the lights.Then Hermione's voice came out of the blackness for the third time, sharp and clear from a few yards away.\\\\\\\"Harry, they're here... right here.\\\\\\\"And he knew by her tone that it was his mother and father this time: He moved toward her, feeling as if something heavy were pressing on his chest, the same sensation he had had right after Dumbledore had died, a grief that had actually weighed on his heart and lungs.The headstone was only two rows behind Kendra and Ariana's. It was made of white marble, just like Dumbledore's tomb, and this made it easy to read, as it seemed to shine in the dark. Harry did not need to kneel or even approach very close to it to make out the words engraved upon it.JAMES POTTER LILY POTTER BORN 27 MARCH 1960 BORN 30 JANUARY 1960 DIED 31 OCTOBER 1981 DIED 31 OCTOBER 1981 The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.Harry read the words slowly, as though he would have only one chance to take in their meaning, and he read the last of them aloud.\\\\\\\"'The last enemy that shall be defeated is death'...\\\\\\\" A horrible thought came to him, and with a kind of panic. \\\\\\\"Isn't that a Death Eater idea? Why is that there?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"It doesn't mean defeating death in the way the Death Eaters mean it, Harry,\\\\\\\" said Hermione, her voice gentle. \\\\\\\"It means... you know... living beyond death. Living after death.\\\\\\\"But they were not living, thought Harry. They were gone. The empty words could not disguise the fact that his parents' moldering remains lay beneath snow and stone, indifferent, unknowing. And tears came before he could stop them, boiling hot then instantly freezing on his face, and what was the point in wiping them off or pretending? He let them fall, his lips pressed hard together, looking down at the thick snow hiding from his eyes the place where the last of Lily and James lay, bones now, surely, or dust, not knowing or caring that their living son stood so near, his heart still beating, alive because of their sacrifice and close to wishing, at this moment, that he was sleeping under the snow with them.Hermione had taken his hand again and was gripping it tightly. He could not look at her, but returned the pressure, now taking deep, sharp gulps of the night air, trying to steady himself, trying to regain control. He should have brought something o give them, and he had not thought of it, and every plant in the graveyard was leafless and frozen. But Hermione raised her wand, moved it in a circle through the air, and a wreath of Christmas roses blossomed before them. Harry caught it and laid it on his parents' grave.As soon as he stood up he wanted to leave: He did not think he could stand another moment there. He put his arm around Hermione's shoulders, and she put hers around his waist, and they turned in silence and walked away through the snow, past Dumbledore's mother and sister, back toward the dark church and the out-of-sight kissing gate.\\u00a0\\\"\",\n          \"The enchanted ceiling of the Great Hall was dark and scattered with stars, and below it the four long House tables were lined with disheveled students, some in traveling cloaks, others in dressing gowns. Here and there shone the pearly white figures of the school ghosts. Every eye, living and dead was fixed upon Professor McGonagall, who was speaking from the raised platform at the top of the Hall. Behind her stood the remaining teaches, including the palomino centaur, Firenze, and the members of the Order of the Phoenix who had arrived to fight.\\\\...evacuation will be overseen by Mr. Filch and Madame Pomfrey. Prefects, when I give the word, you will organize your House and take your charges in orderly fashion to the evacuation point.\\\\\\\"Many of the students looked petrified. However, as Harry skirted the walls, scanning the Gryffindor table for Ron and Hermione, Ernie Macmillan stood up at the Hufflepuff table and shouted; \\\\\\\"And what if we want to stay and fight?\\\\\\\"There was a smattering of applause.\\\\\\\"If you are of age, you may stay.\\\\\\\" said Professor McGonagall.\\\\\\\"What about our things?\\\\\\\" called a girl at the Ravenclaw table. \\\\\\\"Our trunks, our owls?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"We have no time to collect possessions.\\\\\\\" said Professor McGonagall. \\\\\\\"The important thing is to get you out of here safely.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Where's Professor Snape?\\\\\\\" shouted a girl from the Slytherin table.\\\\\\\"He has, to use the common phrase, done a bunk.\\\\\\\" replied Professor McGonagall and a great cheer erupted from the Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs, and Ravenclaws.Harry moved up the Hall alongside the Gryffindor table, still looking for Ron and Hermione. As he passed, faces turned in his direction, and a great deal of whispering broke out in his wake.\\\\\\\"We have already placed protection around the castle,\\\\\\\" Professor McGonagall was saying, \\\\\\\"but it is unlikely to hold for very long unless we reinforce it. I must ask you, therefore, to move quickly and calmly, and do as your prefects \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"But her final words were drowned as a different voice echoed throughout the Hall. It was high, cold, and clear. There was no telling from where it came. It seemed to issue from the walls themselves. Like the monster it had once commanded, it might have lain dormant there for centuries.\\\\\\\"I know that you are preparing to fight.\\\\\\\" There were screams amongst the students, some of whom clutched each other, looking around in terror for the source of the sound. \\\\\\\"Your efforts are futile. You cannot fight me. I do not want to kill you. I have great respect for the teachers of Hogwarts. I do not want to spill magical blood.\\\\\\\"There was silence in the Hall now, the kind of silence that presses against the eardrums, that seems too huge to be contained by walls.\\\\\\\"Give me Harry Potter,\\\\\\\" said Voldemort's voice, \\\\\\\"and they shall not be harmed. Give me Harry Potter and I shall leave the school untouched. Give me Harry Potter and you will be rewarded.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"You have until midnight.\\\\\\\"The silence swallowed them all again. Every head turned, every eye in the place seemed to have found Harry, to hold him forever in the glare of thousands of invisible beams. Then a figure rose from the Slytherin table and he recognized Pansy Parkinson as she raised a shaking arm and screamed, \\\\\\\"But he's there! Potter's there. Someone grab him!\\\\\\\"Before Harry could speak, there was a massive movement. The Gryffindors in front of him had risen and stood facing, not Harry, but the Slytherins. Then the Hufflepuffs stood, and almost at the same moment, the Ravenclaws, all of them with their backs to Harry, all of them looking toward Pansy instead, and Harry, awestruck and overwhelmed, saw wands emerging everywhere, pulled from beneath cloaks and from under sleeves.\\\\\\\"Thank you, Miss Parkinson.\\\\\\\" said Professor McGonagall in a clipped voice. \\\\\\\"You will leave the Hall first with Mr. Filch. If the rest of your House could follow.\\\\\\\"Harry heard the grinding of the benches and then the sound of the Slytherins trooping out on the other side of the Hall.\\\\\\\"Ravenclaws, follow on!\\\\\\\" cried Professor McGonagall.Slowly the four tables emptied. The Slytherin table was completely deserted, but a number of older Ravenclaws remained seated while their fellows filed out; even more Hufflepuffs stayed behind, and half of Gryffindor remained in their seats, necessitating Professor McGonagall's descent from the teachers' platform to chivvy the underage on their way.\\\\\\\"Absolutely not, Creevey, go! And you, Peakes!\\\\\\\"Harry hurried over to the Weasleys, all sitting together at the Gryffindor table.\\\\\\\"Where are Ron and Hermione?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Haven't you found -?\\\\\\\" began Mr. Weasley, looking worried.But he broke off as Kingsley had stepped forward on the raised platform to address those who had remained behind.\\\\\\\"We've only got half an half an hour until midnight, so we need to act fast. A battle plan has been agreed between the teachers of Hogwarts and the Order of the Phoenix. Professors Flitwick, Sprout and McGonagall are going to take groups of fighters up to the three highest towers \\u00a8C Ravenclaw, Astronomy, and Gryffindor \\u00a8C where they'll have good overview, excellent positions from which to work spells. Meanwhile Remus\\\\\\\" \\u00a8C he indicated Lupin \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"Arthur\\\\\\\" \\u00a8C he pointed toward Mr. Weasley, sitting at the Gryffindor table \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"and I will take groups into the grounds. We'll need somebody to organize defense of the entrances or the passageways into the school \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Sounds like a job for us.\\\\\\\" called Fred, indicating himself and George, and Kingsley nodded his approval.\\\\\\\"All right, leaders up here and we'll divide up the troops!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Potter,\\\\\\\" said Professor McGonagall, hurrying up to him, as students flooded the platform, jostling for position, receiving instructions, \\\\\\\"Aren't you supposed to be looking for something?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"What? Oh,\\\\\\\" said Harry, \\\\\\\"oh yeah!\\\\\\\"He had almost forgotten about the Horcrux, almost forgotten that the battle was being fought so that he could search for it: The inexplicable absence of Ron and Hermione had momentarily driven every other thought from his mind.\\\\\\\"Then go, Potter, go!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Right \\u00a8C yeah \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"He sensed eyes following him as he ran out of the Great Hall again, into the entrance hall still crowded with evacuating students. He allowed himself to be swept up the marble staircase with them, but at the top he hurried off along a deserted corridor. Fear and panic were clouding his thought processes. He tried to calm himself, to concentrate on finding the Horcrux, but his thoughts buzzed as frantically and fruitlessly as wasps trapped beneath a glass. Without Ron and Hermione to help him he could not seem to marshal his ideas. He slowed down, coming to a halt halfway along a passage, where he sat down on the plinth of a departed statue and pulled the Marauder's Map out of the pouch around his neck. He could not see Ron's of Hermione's names anywhere on it, though the density of the crowd of dots now making its way to the Room of Requirement might, he thought, be concealing them. He put the map away, pressed his hands over his face, and closed his eyes, trying to concentrate.Voldemort thought I'd go to Ravenclaw Tower.There it was, a solid fact, the place to start. Voldemort had stationed Alecto Carrow in the Ravenclaw common room, and there could be only one explanation; Voldemort feared that Harry already knew his Horcrux was connected to that House.But the only object anyone seemed to associate with Ravenclaw was the lost diadem... and how could the Horcrux be the diadem? How was it possible that Voldemort, the Slytherin, had found the diadem that had eluded generations of Ravenclaws? Who could have told him where to look, when nobody had seen the diadem in living memory?In living memory...Beneath his fingers, Harry's eyes flew open again. He leapt up from the plinth and tore back the way he had come, now in pursuit of his one last hope. The sound of hundreds of people marching toward the Room of Requirement grew louder and louder as he returned to the marble stairs. Prefects were shouting instructions, trying to keep track of the students in their own houses, there was much pushing and shouting; Harry saw Zacharias Smith bowling over first years to get to the front of the queue, here and there younger students were in tears, while older ones called desperately for friends or siblings.Harry caught sight of a pearly white figure drifting across the entrance hall below and yelled as loudly as he could over the clamor.\\\\\\\"Nick! NICK! I need to talk to you!\\\\\\\"He forced his way back through the tide of students, finally reaching the bottom of the stairs, where Nearly Headless Nick, ghost of Gryffindor Tower, stood waiting for him.\\\\\\\"Harry! My dear boy!\\\\\\\"Nick made to grasp Harry's hands with both of his own; Harry felt as though they had been thrust into icy water.\\\\\\\"Nick, you've got to help me. Who's the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?\\\\\\\"Nearly Headless Nick looked surprised and a little offended.\\\\\\\"The Gray Lady, of course; but if it is ghostly services you require -?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"It's got to be her \\u00a8C d'you know where she is?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Let's see...\\\\\\\"Nick's head wobbled a little on his ruff as he turned hither and thither, peering over the heads of the swarming students.\\\\\\\"That's her over there, Harry, the young woman with the long hair.\\\\\\\"Harry looked in the direction of Nick's transparent, pointing finger and saw a tall ghost who caught sight of Harry looking at her, raised her eyebrows, and drifted away through a solid wall.Harry ran after her. Once through the door of the corridor into which she had disappeared, he saw her at the very end of the passage, still gliding smoothly away from him.\\\\\\\"Hey \\u00a8C wait \\u00a8C come back!\\\\\\\"She consented to pause, floating a few inches from the ground. Harry supposed that she was beautiful, with her waist-length hair and floor-length cloak, but she also looked haughty and proud. Close in, he recognized her as a ghost he had passed several times in the corridor, but to whom he had never spoken.\\\\\\\"You're the Gray Lady?\\\\\\\"She nodded but did not speak.\\\\\\\"The ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"That is correct.\\\\\\\"Her tone was not encouraging.\\\\\\\"Please, I need some help. I need to know anything you can tell me about the lost diadem.\\\\\\\"A cold smile curved her lips.\\\\\\\"I am afraid,\\\\\\\" she said, turning to leave, \\\\\\\"that I cannot help you.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"WAIT!\\\\\\\"He had not meant to shout, but anger and panic were threatening to overwhelm him. He glanced at his watch as she hovered in front of him. It was a quarter to midnight.\\\\\\\"This is urgent.\\\\\\\" he said fiercely. \\\\\\\"If that diadem's at Hogwarts, I've got to find it, fast.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"You are hardly the first student to covet the diadem.\\\\\\\" she said disdainfully. \\\\\\\"Generations of students have badgered me \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"This isn't about trying to get better marks!\\\\\\\" Harry shouted at her, \\\\\\\"It's about Voldemort \\u00a8C defeating Voldemort \\u00a8C or aren't you interested in that?\\\\\\\"She could not blush, but her transparent cheeks became more opaque, and her voice was heated as she replied, \\\\\\\"Of course I \\u00a8C how dare you suggest \\u00a8C?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Well, help me then!\\\\\\\"Her composure was slipping.\\\\\\\"It \\u00a8C it is not a question of \\u00a8C \\\\\\\" she stammered. \\\\\\\"My mother's diadem \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Your mother's?\\\\\\\"She looked angry with herself.\\\\\\\"When I lived,\\\\\\\" she said stiffly, \\\\\\\"I was Helena Ravenclaw.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"You're her daughter? But then, you must know what happed to it.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"While the diadem bestows wisdom,\\\\\\\" she said with an obvious effort to pull herself together, \\\\\\\"I doubt that it would greatly increase you chances of defeating the wizard who calls himself Lord \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Haven't I told you, I'm not interested in wearing it!\\\\\\\" Harry said fiercely. \\\\\\\"There's no time to explain \\u00a8C but if you care about Hogwarts, if you want to see Voldemort finished, you've got to tell me anything you know about the diadem!\\\\\\\"She remained quite still, floating in midair, staring down at him, and a sense of hopelessness engulfed Harry. Of course, if she had known anything, she would have told Flitwick of Dumbledore, who had surely asked her the same question. He had shaken his head and made to turn away when she spoke in a low voice.\\\\\\\"I stole the diadem from my mother.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"You \\u00a8C you did what?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I stole the diadem.\\\\\\\" repeated Helena Ravenclaw in a whisper. \\\\\\\"I sought to make myself cleverer, more important than my mother. I ran away with it.\\\\\\\"He did not know how he had managed to gain her confidence and did not ask, he simply listened, hard, as she went on.\\\\\\\"My mother, they say, never admitted that the diadem was gone, but pretended that she had it still. She concealed her loss, my dreadful betrayal, even from the other founders of Hogwarts.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Then my mother fell ill \\u00a8C fatally ill. In spite of my perfidy, she was desperate to see me one more time. She sent a man who had long loved me, though I spurned his advances, to find me. She knew that he would not rest until he had done so.\\\\\\\"Harry waited. She drew a deep breath and threw back her head.\\\\\\\"He tracked me to the forest where I was hiding. When I refused to return with him, he became violent. The baron was always a hot-tempered man. Furious at my refusal, jealous of my freedom, he stabbed me.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"The Baron? You mean -?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"The Bloody Baron, yes,\\\\\\\" said the Gray Lady, and she lifted aside the cloak she wore to reveal a single dark wound in her white chest. \\\\\\\"When he saw what he had done, he was overcome with remorse. He took the weapon that had claimed my life, and used it to kill himself. All these centuries later, he wears his chains as an act of penitence... as he should.\\\\\\\" she added bitterly.\\\\\\\"And \\u00a8C and the diadem?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"It remained where I had hidden it when I heard the Baron blundering through the forest toward me. Concealed inside a hollow tree.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"A hollow tree?\\\\\\\" repeated Harry. \\\\\\\"What tree? Where was this?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"A forest in Albania. A lonely place I thought was far beyond my mother's reach.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Albania,\\\\\\\" repeated Harry. Sense was emerging miraculously from confusion, and now he understood why she was telling him what she had denied Dumbledore and Flitwick. \\\\\\\"You've already told someone this story, haven't you? Another student?\\\\\\\"She closed her eyes and nodded.\\\\\\\"I had... no idea... He was flattering. He seemed to... understand... to sympathize...\\\\\\\"Yes, Harry thought. Tom Riddle would certainly have understood Helena Ravenclaw's desire to possess fabulous objects to which she had little right.\\\\\\\"Well, you weren't the first person Riddle wormed things out of.\\\\\\\" Harry muttered. \\\\\\\"He could be charming when he wanted...\\\\\\\"So, Voldemort had managed to wheedle the location of the lost diadem out of the Gray Lady. He had traveled to that far-flung forest and retrieved the diadem from its hiding place, perhaps as soon as he left Hogwarts, before he even started work at Borgin and Burkes.And wouldn't those secluded Albanian woods have seemed an excellent refuge when, so much later, Voldemort and needed a place to lie low, undisturbed, for ten long years?But the diadem, once it became his precious Horcrux, had not been left in that lowly tree.... No, the diadem had been returned secretly to its true home, and Voldemort must have put it there \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\u00a8C the night he asked for a job!\\\\\\\" said Harry, finishing his thought.\\\\\\\"I beg your pardon?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"He hid the diadem in the castle, the night he asked Dumbledore to let him teach!\\\\\\\" said Harry. Saying it out loud enabled him to make sense of it all. \\\\\\\"He must've hidden the diadem on his way up to, or down from, Dumbledore's office! But it was well worth trying to get the job \\u00a8C then he might've got the chance to nick Gryffindor's sword as well \\u00a8C thank you, thanks!\\\\\\\"Harry left her floating there, looking utterly bewildered. As he rounded the corner back into the entrance hall, he checked his watch. It was five minutes until midnight, and though he now knew what the last Horcrux was, he was no closer to discovering where it was...Generations of students had failed to find the diadem; that suggested that it was not in Ravenclaw Tower \\u00a8C but if not there, where? What hiding place had Tom Riddle discovered inside Hogwarts Castle, that he believed would remain secret forever?Lost in desperate speculation, Harry turned a corner, but he had taken only a few steps down the new corridor when the window to his left broke open with a deafening, shattering crash. As he leapt aside, a gigantic body flew in through the window and hit the opposite wall.Something large and furry detached itself, whimpering, from the new arrival and flung itself at Harry.\\\\\\\"Hagrid!\\\\\\\" Harry bellowed, fighting off Fang the boarhound's attentions as the enormous bearded figure clambered to his feet \\\\\\\"What the \\u00a8C?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Harry, yer here! Yer here!\\\\\\\"Hagrid stooped down, bestowed upon Harry a cursory and rib-cracking hug, then ran back to the shattered window.\\\\\\\"Good boy, Grawpy!\\\\\\\" he bellowed through the hole in the window. \\\\\\\"I'll se yer in a moment, there's a good lad!\\\\\\\"Beyond Hagrid, out in the dark night, Harry saw bursts of light in the distance and heard a weird, keening scream. He looked down at his watch: It was midnight. The battle had begun.\\\\\\\"Blimey, Harry,\\\\\\\" panted Hagrid, \\\\\\\"this is it, eh? Time ter fight?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Hagrid, where have you come from?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Heard You-Know-Who from up in our cave,\\\\\\\" said Hagrid grimly. \\\\\\\"Voice carried, didn't it? 'Yet got till midnight ter gimme Potter.' Knew yeh mus' be here, knew that mus' be happenin'. Get down, Fang. So we come ter join in, me an' Grawpy an' Fang. Smashed our way through the boundary by the forest, Grawpy was carryin' us, Fang an' me. Told him ter let me down at the castle, so he shoved me through the window, bless him. Not exactly what I meant, bu' \\u00a8C where's Ron an' Hermione?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"That,\\\\\\\" said Harry, \\\\\\\"is a really good question. Come on.\\\\\\\"They hurried together along the corridor, Fang lolloping beside them. Harry could hear movement through the corridors all around: running footsteps, shouts; through the windows, he could see more flashes of light in the dark grounds.\\\\\\\"Where're we goin'?\\\\\\\" puffed Hagrid, pounding along at Harry's heels, making the floorboards quake.\\\\\\\"I dunno exactly,\\\\\\\" said Harry, making another random turn, \\\\\\\"but Ron and Hermione must be around here somewhere....\\\\\\\"The first casualties of the battle were already strewn across the passage ahead: The two stone gargoyles that usually guarded the entrance to the staffroom had been smashed apart by a jinx that had sailed through another broken window. Their remains stirred feebly on the floor, and as Harry leapt over one of their disembodied heads, it moaned faintly. \\\\\\\"Oh, don't mind me... I'll just be here and crumble....\\\\\\\"Its ugly stone face made Harry think suddenly of the marble bust of Rowena Ravenclaw at Xenophilius's house, wearing that mad headdress \\u00a8C and then of the statue in Ravenclaw Tower, with the stone diadem upon her white curls....And as he reached the end of the passage, the memory of a third stone effigy came back to him: that of an ugly old warlock, onto whose head Harry himself had placed a wig and a battered old hat. The shock shot through Harry with the heat of firewhisky, and he nearly stumbled.He knew, at least, where the Horcrux sat waiting for him....Tom Riddle, who confided in no one and operated alone, might have been arrogant enough to assume that he, and only he, had penetrated the deepest mysteries of Hogwarts Castle. Of course, Dumbledore and Flitwick, those model pupils, had never set foot in that particular place, but he, Harry, had strayed off the beaten track in his time at school \\u00a8C here at least was a secret area he and Voldemort knew, that Dumbledore had never discovered \\u00a8CHe was roused by Professor Sprout, who was thundering past followed by Neville and half a dozen others, all of them wearing earmuffs and carrying what appeared to be large potted plants.\\\\\\\"Mandrakes!\\\\\\\" Neville bellowed at Harry over his shoulder as he ran. \\\\\\\"Going to lob them over the walls \\u00a8C they won't like this!\\\\\\\"Harry knew now where to go. He sped off, with Hagrid and Fang galloping behind him. They passed portrait after portrait, and the painted figures raced alongside them, wizards and witches in ruffs and breeches, in armor and cloaks, cramming themselves into each others' canvases, screaming news from other parts of the castle. As they reached the end of this corridor, the whole castle shook, and Harry knew, as a gigantic vase blew off its plinth with explosive force, that it was in the grip of enchantments more sinister than those of the teachers and the Order.\\\\\\\"It's all righ', Fang \\u00a8C it's all righ'!\\\\\\\" yelled Hagrid, but the great boarhound had taken flight as slivers of china flew like shrapnel through the air, and Hagrid pounded off after the terrified dog, leaving Harry alone.He forged on through the trembling passages, his wand at the ready, and for the length of one corridor the little painted knight, Sir Cadrigan, rushed from painting to painting beside him, clanking along in his armor, screaming encouragement, his fat little pony cantering behind him.\\\\\\\"Braggarts and rogues, dogs and scoundrels, drive them out, Harry Potter, see them off!\\\\\\\"Harry hurtled around a corner and found Fred and a small knot of students, including Lee Jordan and Hannah Abbott, standing beside another empty plinth, whose statue had concealed a secret passageway. Their wands were drawn and they were listening at the concealed hole.\\\\\\\"Nice night for it!\\\\\\\" Fred shouted as the castle quaked again, and Harry sprinted by, elated and terrified in equal measure. Along yet another corridor he dashed, and then there were owls everywhere, and Mrs. Norris was hissing and trying to bat them with her paws, no doubt to return them to their proper place....\\\\\\\"Potter!\\\\\\\"Aberforth Dumbledore stood blocking the corridor ahead, his wand held ready.\\\\\\\"I've had hundreds of kids thundering through my pub, Potter!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I know, we're evacuating,\\\\\\\" Harry said, \\\\\\\"Voldemort's \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\u00a8C attacking because they haven't handed you over, yeah,\\\\\\\" said Aberforth. \\\\\\\"I'm not deaf, the whole of Hogsmeade heard him. And it never occurred to any of you to keep a few Slytherins hostage? There are kids of Death Eaters you've just sent to safety. Wouldn't it have been a bit smarter to keep 'em here?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"It wouldn't stop Voldemort,\\\\\\\" said Harry, \\\\\\\"and your brother would never have done it.\\\\\\\"Aberforth grunted and tore away in the opposite direction.Your brother would never have done it.... Well, it was the truth, Harry thought as he ran on again: Dumbledore, who had defended Snape for so long, would never have held students ransom....And then he skidded around a final corner and with a yell of mingled relief and fury he saw them: Ron and Hermione; both with their arms full of large, curved, dirty yellow objects, Ron with a broomstick under his arms.\\\\\\\"Where the hell have you been?\\\\\\\" Harry shouted.\\\\\\\"Chamber of Secrets,\\\\\\\" said Ron.\\\\\\\"Chamber \\u00a8C what?\\\\\\\" said Harry, coming to an unsteady halt before them.\\\\\\\"It was Ron, all Ron's idea!\\\\\\\" said Hermione breathlessly. \\\\\\\"Wasn't it absolutely brilliant? There we were, after we left, and I said to Ron, even if we find the other one, how are we going to get rid of it? We still hadn't got rid of the cup! And then he thought of it! The basilisk!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"What the \\u00a8C?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Something to get rid of Horcruxes,\\\\\\\" said Ron simply.Harry's eyes dropped to the objects clutched in Ron and Hermione's arms: great curved fangs; torn, he now realized, from the skull of a dead basilisk.\\\\\\\"But how did you get in there?\\\\\\\" he asked, staring from the fangs to Ron. \\\\\\\"You need to speak Parseltongue!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"He did!\\\\\\\" whispered Hermione. \\\\\\\"Show him, Ron!\\\\\\\"Ron made a horrible strangled hissing noise.\\\\\\\"It's what you did to open the locket,\\\\\\\" he told Harry apologetically. \\\\\\\"I had to have a few goes to get it right, but,\\\\\\\" he shrugged modestly, \\\\\\\"we got there in the end.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"He was amazing!\\\\\\\" said Hermione. \\\\\\\"Amazing!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"So...\\\\\\\" Harry was struggling to keep up. \\\\\\\"So...\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"So we're another Horcrux down,\\\\\\\" said Ron, and from under his jacket he pulled the mangled remains of Hufflepuff's cup. \\\\\\\"Hermione stabbed it. Thought she should. She hasn't had the pleasure yet.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Genius!\\\\\\\" yelled Harry.\\\\\\\"It was nothing,\\\\\\\" said Ron, though he looked delighted with himself. \\\\\\\"So what's new with you?\\\\\\\"As he said it, there was an explosion from overhead: All three of them looked up as dust fell from the ceiling and they heard a distant scream.\\\\\\\"I know what the diadem looks like, and I know where it is,\\\\\\\" said Harry, talking fast. \\\\\\\"He hid it exactly where I had my old Potions book, where everyone's been hiding stuff for centuries. He thought he was the only one to find it. Come on.\\\\\\\"As the walls trembled again, he led the other two back through the concealed entrance and down the staircase into the Room of Requirement. It was empty except for three women: Ginny, Tonks and an elderly witch wearing a moth-eaten hat, whom Harry recognized immediately as Neville's grandmother.\\\\\\\"Ah, Potter,\\\\\\\" she said crisply as if she had been waiting for him. \\\\\\\"You can tell us what's going on.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Is everyone okay?\\\\\\\" said Ginny and Tonks together.\\\\\\\"'S far as we know,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"Are there still people in the passage to the Hog's Head?\\\\\\\"He knew that the room would not be able to transform while there were still users inside it.\\\\\\\"I was the last to come through,\\\\\\\" said Mrs. Longbottom. \\\\\\\"I sealed it, I think it unwise to leave it open now Aberforth has left his pub. Have you seen my grandson?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"He's fighting,\\\\\\\" said Harry.\\\\\\\"Naturally,\\\\\\\" said the old lady proudly. \\\\\\\"Excuse me, I must go and assist him.\\\\\\\"With surprising speed she trotted off toward the stone steps.Harry looked at Tonks.\\\\\\\"I thought you were supposed to be with Teddy at your mother's?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I couldn't stand not knowing \\u00a8C \\\\\\\" Tonks looked anguished. \\\\\\\"She'll look after him \\u00a8C have you seen Remus?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"He was planning to lead a group of fighters into the grounds \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"Without another word, Tonks sped off.\\\\\\\"Ginny,\\\\\\\" said Harry, \\\\\\\"I'm sorry, but we need you to leave too. Just for a bit. Then you can come back in.\\\\\\\"Ginny looked simply delighted to leave her sanctuary.\\\\\\\"And then you can come back in!\\\\\\\" he shouted after her as she ran up the steps after Tonks. \\\\\\\"You've got to come back in!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Hang on a moment!\\\\\\\" said Ron sharply. \\\\\\\"We've forgotten someone!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Who?\\\\\\\" asked Hermione.\\\\\\\"The house-elves, they'll all be down in the kitchen, won't they?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"You mean we ought to get them fighting?\\\\\\\" asked Harry.\\\\\\\"No,\\\\\\\" said Ron seriously, \\\\\\\"I mean we should tell them to get out. We don't want anymore Dobbies, do we? We can't order them to die for us \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"There was a clatter as the basilisk fangs cascaded out of Hermione's arms. Running at Ron, she flung them around his neck and kissed him full on the mouth. Ron threw away the fangs and broomstick he was holding and responded with such enthusiasm that he lifted Hermione off her feet.\\\\\\\"Is this the moment?\\\\\\\" Harry asked weakly, and when nothing happened except that Ron and Hermione gripped each other still more firmly and swayed on the spot, he raised his voice. \\\\\\\"Oi! There's a war going on here!\\\\\\\"Ron and Hermione broke apart, their arms still around each other.\\\\\\\"I know, mate,\\\\\\\" said Ron, who looked as though he had recently been hit on the back of the head with a Bludger, \\\\\\\"so it's now or never, isn't it?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Never mind that, what about the Horcrux?\\\\\\\" Harry shouted. \\\\\\\"D'you think you could just \\u00a8C just hold it in until we've got the diadem?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Yeah \\u00a8C right \\u00a8C sorry \\u00a8C \\\\\\\" said Ron, and he and Hermione set about gathering up fangs, both pink in the face.It was clear, as the three of them stepped back into the corridor upstairs, that in the minutes that they had spent in the Room of Requirement the situation within the castle had deteriorated severely: The walls and ceiling were shaking worse than ever; dust filled the air, and through the nearest window, Harry saw bursts of green and red light so close to the foot of the castle that he knew the Death Eaters must be very near to entering the place. Looking down, Harry saw Grawp the giant meandering past, swinging what looked like a stone gargoyle torn from the roof and roaring his displeasure.\\\\\\\"Let's hope he steps on some of them!\\\\\\\" said Ron as more screams echoed from close by.\\\\\\\"As long as it's not any of our lot!\\\\\\\" said a voice: Harry turned and saw Ginny and Tonks, both with their wands drawn at the next window, which was missing several panes. Even as he watched, Ginny sent a well-aimed jinx into a crowd of fighters below.\\\\\\\"Good girl!\\\\\\\" roared a figure running through the dust toward them, and Harry saw Aberforth again, his gray hair flying as he led a small group of students past. \\\\\\\"They look like they might be breaching the north battlements, they've brought giants of their own.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Have you seen Remus?\\\\\\\" Tonks called after him.\\\\\\\"He was dueling Dolohov,\\\\\\\" shouted Aberforth, \\\\\\\"haven't seen him since!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Tonks,\\\\\\\" said Ginny, \\\\\\\"Tonks, I'm sure he's okay \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"But Tonks had run off into the dust after Aberforth.Ginny turned, helpless, to Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\\\\\\\"They'll be all right,\\\\\\\" said Harry, though he knew they were empty words. \\\\\\\"Ginny, we'll be back in a moment, just keep out of the way, keep safe \\u00a8C come on!\\\\\\\" he said to Ron and Hermione, and they ran back to the stretch of wall beyond which the Room of Requirement was waiting to do the bidding of the next entrant.I need the place where everything is hidden. Harry begged of it inside his head, and the door materialized on their third run past.The furor of the battle died the moment they crossed the threshold and closed the door behind them: All was silent. They were in a place the size of a cathedral with the appearance of a city, its towering walls built of objects hidden by thousands of long-gone students.\\\\\\\"And he never realized anyone could get in?\\\\\\\" said Ron, his voice echoing in the silence.\\\\\\\"He thought he was the only one,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"Too bad for him I've had to hide stuff in my time... this way,\\\\\\\" he added. \\\\\\\"I think it's down here....\\\\\\\"They sped off up adjacent aisles; Harry could hear the others' footsteps echoing through the towering piles of junk, of bottles, hats, crates, chairs, books, weapons, broomsticks, bats....\\\\\\\"Somewhere near here,\\\\\\\" Harry muttered to himself. \\\\\\\"Somewhere... somewhere...\\\\\\\"Deeper and deeper into the labyrinth he went, looking for objects he recognized from his one previous trip into the room. His breath was loud in his ears, and then his very soul seemed to shiver. There it was, right ahead, the blistered old cupboard in which he had hidden his old Potions book, and on top of it, the pockmarked stone warlock wearing a dusty old wig and what looked like an ancient discolored tiara.He had already stretched out his hand, though he remained few feet away, when a voice behind him said, \\\\\\\"Hold it, Potter.\\\\\\\"He skidded to a halt and turned around. Crabbe and Goyle were standing behind him, shoulder to shoulder, wands pointing right at Harry. Through the small space between their jeering faces he saw Draco Malfoy.\\\\\\\"That's my wand you're holding, Potter,\\\\\\\" said Malfoy, pointing his own through the gap between Crabbe and Goyle.\\\\\\\"Not anymore,\\\\\\\" panted Harry, tightening his grip on the hawthorn wand. \\\\\\\"Winners, keepers, Malfoy. Who's lent you theirs?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"My mother,\\\\\\\" said Draco.Harry laughed, though there was nothing very humorous about the situation. He could not hear Ron or Hermione anymore. They seemed to have run out of earshot, searching for the diadem.\\\\\\\"So how come you three aren't with Voldemort?\\\\\\\" asked Harry.\\\\\\\"We're gonna be rewarded,\\\\\\\" said Crabbe. His voice was surprisingly soft for such an enormous person: Harry had hardly ever heard him speak before. Crabbe was speaking like a small child promised a large bag of sweets. \\\\\\\"We 'ung back, Potter. We decided not to go. Decided to bring you to 'im.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Good plan,\\\\\\\" said Harry in mock admiration. He could not believe that he was this close, and was going to be thwarted by Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. He began edging slowly backward toward the place where the Horcrux sat lopsided upon the bust. If he could just get his hands on it before the fight broke out...\\\\\\\"So how did you get in here?\\\\\\\" he asked, trying to distract them.\\\\\\\"I virtually lived in the Room of Hidden Things all last year,\\\\\\\" said Malfoy, his voice brittle. \\\\\\\"I know how to get in.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"We was hiding in the corridor outside,\\\\\\\" grunted Goyle. \\\\\\\"We can do Disslusion Charms now! And then,\\\\\\\" his face split into a gormless grin, \\\\\\\"you turned up right in front of us and said you was looking for a die-dum! What's a die-dum?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Harry?\\\\\\\" Ron's voice echoed suddenly from the other side of the wall to Harry's right. \\\\\\\"Are you talking to someone?\\\\\\\"With a whiplike movement, Crabbe pointed his wand at the fifty foot mountain of old furniture, of broken trunks, of old books and robes and unidentifiable junk, and shouted, \\\\\\\"Descendo!\\\\\\\"The wall began to totter, then the top third crumbled into the aisle next door where Ron stood.\\\\\\\"Ron!\\\\\\\" Harry bellowed, as somewhere out of sight Hermione screamed, and Harry heard innumerable objects crashing to the floor on the other side of the destabilized wall: He pointed his wand at the rampart, cried, \\\\\\\"Finite!\\\\\\\" and it steadied.\\\\\\\"No!\\\\\\\" shouted Malfoy, staying Crabbe's arm as the latter made to repeat his spell. \\\\\\\"If you wreck the room you might bury this diadem thing!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"What's that matter?\\\\\\\" said Crabbe, tugging himself free. \\\\\\\"It's Potter the Dark Lord wants, who cares about a die-dum?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Potter came in here to get it,\\\\\\\" said Malfoy with ill-disguised impatience at the slow-wittedness of his colleagues. \\\\\\\"so that must mean \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"'Must mean'?\\\\\\\" Crabbe turned on Malfoy with undisguised ferocity. \\\\\\\"Who cares what you think? I don't take your orders no more, Draco. You an' your dad are finished.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Harry?\\\\\\\" shouted Ron again, from the other side of the junk wad. \\\\\\\"What's going on?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Harry?\\\\\\\" mimicked Crabbe. \\\\\\\"What's going on \\u00a8C no, Potter! Crucio!\\\\\\\"Harry had lunged for the tiara; Crabbe's curse missed him but hit the stone bust, which flew into the air; the diadem soared upward and then dropped out of sight in the mass of objects on which the bust had rested.\\\\\\\"STOP!\\\\\\\" Malfoy shouted at Crabbe, his voice echoing through the enormous room. \\\\\\\"The Dark Lord wants him alive \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"So? I'm not killing him, am I?\\\\\\\" yelled Crabbe, throwing off Malfoy's restraining arm. \\\\\\\"But if I can, I will, the Dark Lord wants him dead anyway, what's the diff \\u00a8C?\\\\\\\"A jet of scarlet light shot past Harry by inches: Hermione had run around the corner behind him and sent a Stunning Spell straight at Crabbe's head. It only missed because Malfoy pulled him out of the way.\\\\\\\"It's that Mudblood! Avada Kedavra!\\\\\\\"Harry saw Hermione dive aside, and his fury that Crabbe had aimed to kill wiped all else from his mind. He shot a Stunning Spell at Crabbe, who lurched out of the way, knocking Malfoy's wand out of his hand; it rolled out of sight beneath a mountain of broken furniture and bones.\\\\\\\"Don't kill him! DON'T KILL HIM!\\\\\\\" Malfoy yelled at Crabbe and Goyle, who were both aiming at Harry: Their split second's hesitation was all Harry needed.\\\\\\\"Expelliarmus!\\\\\\\"Goyle's wand flew out of his hand and disappeared into the bulwark of objects beside him; Goyle leapt foolishly on the spot, trying to retrieve it; Malfoy jumped out of range of Hermione's second Stunning Spell, and Ron, appearing suddenly at the end of the aisle, shot a full Body-Bind Curse at Crabbe, which narrowly missed.Crabbe wheeled around and screamed, \\\\\\\"Avada Kedavra!\\\\\\\" again. Ron leapt out of sight to avoid the jet of green light. The wand-less Malfoy cowered behind a three-legged wardrobe as Hermione charged toward them, hitting Goyle with a Stunning Spell as she came.\\\\\\\"It's somewhere here!\\\\\\\" Harry yelled at her, pointing at the pile of junk into which the old tiara had fallen. \\\\\\\"Look for it while I go and help R \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"HARRY!\\\\\\\" she screamed.A roaring, billowing noise behind him gave him a moment's warning. He turned and saw both Ron and Crabbe running as hard as they could up the aisle toward them.\\\\\\\"Like it hot, scum?\\\\\\\" roared Crabbe as he ran.But he seemed to have no control over what he had done. Flames of abnormal size were pursuing them, licking up the sides of the junk bulwarks, which were crumbling to soot at their touch.\\\\\\\"Aguamenti!\\\\\\\" Harry bawled, but the jet of water that soared from the tip of his wand evaporated in the air.\\\\\\\"RUN!\\\\\\\"Malfoy grabbed the Stunned Goyle and dragged him along; Crabbe outstripped all of them, now looking terrified; Harry, Ron, and Hermione pelted along in his wake, and the fire pursued them. It was not normal fire; Crabbe had used a curse of which Harry had no knowledge. As they turned a corner the flames chased them as though they were alive, sentient, intent upon killing them. Now the fire was mutating, forming a gigantic pack of fiery beasts: Flaming serpents, chimaeras, and dragons rose and fell and rose again, and the detritus of centuries on which they were feeding was thrown up into the air into their fanged mouths, tossed high on clawed feet, before being consumed by the inferno.Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had vanished from view: Harry, Ron and Hermione stopped dead; the fiery monsters were circling them, drawing closer and closer, claws and horns and tails lashed, and the heat was solid as a wall around them.\\\\\\\"What can we do?\\\\\\\" Hermione screamed over the deafening roars of the fire. \\\\\\\"What can we do?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Here!\\\\\\\"Harry seized a pair of heavy-looking broomsticks from the nearest pile of junk and threw one to Ron, who pulled Hermione onto it behind him. Harry swung his leg over the second broom and, with hard kicks to the ground, they soared up in the air, missing by feet the horned beak of a flaming raptor that snapped its jaws at them. The smoke and heat were becoming overwhelming: Below them the cursed fire was consuming the contraband of generations of hunted students, the guilty outcomes of a thousand banned experiments, the secrets of the countless souls who had sought refuge in the room. Harry could not see a trace of Malfoy, Crabbe, or Goyle anywhere. He swooped as low as he dare over the marauding monsters of flame to try to find them, but there was nothing but fire: What a terrible way to die.... He had never wanted this....\\\\\\\"Harry, let's get out, let's get out!\\\\\\\" bellowed Ron, though it was impossible to see where the door was through the black smoke.And then Harry heard a thin, piteous human scream from amidst the terrible commotion, the thunder of devouring flame.\\\\\\\"It's \\u00a8C too \\u00a8C dangerous \\u00a8C!\\\\\\\" Ron yelled, but Harry wheeled in the air. His glasses giving his eyes some small protection from the smoke, he raked the firestorm below, seeking a sign of life, a limb or a face that was not yet charred like wood....And he saw them: Malfoy with his arms around the unconscious Goyle, the pair of them perched on a fragile tower of charred desks, and Harry dived. Malfoy saw him coming and raised one arm, but even as Harry grasped it he knew at once that it was no good. Goyle was too heavy and Malfoy's hand, covered in sweat, slid instantly out of Harry's \\u00a8C\\\\\\\"IF WE DIE FOR THEM, I'LL KILL YOU, HARRY!\\\\\\\" roared Ron's voice, and, as a great flaming chimaera bore down upon them, he and Hermione dragged Goyle onto their broom and rose, rolling and pitching, into the air once more as Malfoy clambered up behind Harry.\\\\\\\"The door, get to the door, the door!\\\\\\\" screamed Malfoy in Harry's ear, and Harry sped up, following Ron, Hermione, and Goyle through the billowing black smoke, hardly able to breathe: and all around them the last few objects unburned by the devouring flames were flung into the air, as the creatures of the cursed fire cast them high in celebration: cups and shields, a sparkling necklace, and an old, discolored tiara \\u00a8C\\\\\\\"What are you doing, what are you doing, the door's that way!\\\\\\\" screamed Malfoy, but Harry made a hairpin swerve and dived. The diadem seemed to fall in slow motion, turning and glittering as it dropped toward the maw of a yawning serpent, and then he had it, caught it around his wrist \\u00a8CHarry swerved again as the serpent lunged at him; he soared upward and straight toward the place where, he prayed, the door stood open; Ron, Hermione and Goyle had vanished; Malfoy was screaming and holding Harry so tightly it hurt. Then, through the smoke, Harry saw a rectangular patch on the wall and steered the broom at it, and moments later clean air filled his lungs and they collided with the wall in the corridor beyond.Malfoy fell off the broom and lay facedown, gasping, coughing, and retching. Harry rolled over and sat up: The door to the Room of Requirement had vanished, and Ron and Hermione sat panting on the floor beside Goyle, who was still unconscious.\\\\\\\"C-Crabbe,\\\\\\\" choked Malfoy as soon as he could speak. \\\\\\\"C-Crabbe...\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"He's dead,\\\\\\\" said Ron harshly.There was silence, apart from panting and coughing. Then a number of huge bangs shook the castle, and a great cavalcade of transparent figures galloped past on horses, their heads screaming with bloodlust under their arms. Harry staggered to his feet when the Headless Hunt had passed and looked around: The battle was still going on all around him. He could hear more scream than those of the retreating ghosts. Panic flared within him.\\\\\\\"Where's Ginny?\\\\\\\" he said sharply. \\\\\\\"She was here. She was supposed to be going back into the Room of Requirement.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Blimey, d'you reckon it'll still work after that fire?\\\\\\\" asked Ron, but he too got to his feet, rubbing his chest and looking left and right. \\\\\\\"Shall we split up and look \\u00a8C?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"No,\\\\\\\" said Hermione, getting to her feet too. Malfoy and Goyle remained slumped hopelessly on the corridor floor; neither of them had wands. \\\\\\\"Let's stick together. I say we go \\u00a8C Harry, what's that on your arm?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"What? Oh yeah \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"He pulled the diadem from his wrist and held it up. It was still hot, blackened with soot, but as he looked at it closely he was just able to make out the tiny words etched upon it; WIT BEYOND MEASURE IS MAN'S GREATEST TREASURE.A bloodlike substance, dark and tarry, seemed to be leaking from the diadem. Suddenly Harry felt the thing vibrate violently, then break apart in his hands, and as it did so, he thought he heard the faintest, most distant scream of pain, echoing not from the grounds or the castle, but from the thing that had just fragmented in his fingers.\\\\\\\"It must have been Fiendfyre!\\\\\\\" whimpered Hermione, her eyes on the broken piece.\\\\\\\"Sorry?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Fiendfyre \\u00a8C cursed fire \\u00a8C it's one of the substances that destroy Horcruxes, but I would never, ever have dared use it, it's so dangerous \\u00a8C how did Crabbe know how to \\u00a8C?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Must've learned from the Carrows,\\\\\\\" said Harry grimly.\\\\\\\"Shame he wasn't concentrating when they mentioned how to stop it, really,\\\\\\\" said Ron, whose hair, like Hermione's, was singed, and whose face was blackened. \\\\\\\"If he hadn't tried to kill us all, I'd be quite sorry he was dead.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"But don't you realize?\\\\\\\" whispered Hermione. \\\\\\\"This means, if we can just get the snake \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"But she broke off as yells and shouts and the unmistakable noises of dueling filled the corridor. Harry looked around and his heart seemed to fail: Death Eaters had penetrated Hogwarts. Fred and Percy had just backed into view, both of them dueling masked and hooded men.Harry, Ron, and Hermione ran forward to help: Jets of light flew in every direction and the man dueling Percy backed off, fast: Then his hood slipped and they saw a high forehead and streaked hair \\u00a8C\\\\\\\"Hello, Minister!\\\\\\\" bellowed Percy, sending a neat jinx straight at Thicknesse, who dropped his wand and clawed at the front of his robes, apparently in awful discomfort. \\\\\\\"Did I mention I'm resigning?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"You're joking, Perce!\\\\\\\" shouted Fred as the Death Eater he was battling collapsed under the weight of three separate Stunning Spells. Thicknesse had fallen to the ground with tiny spikes erupting all over him; he seemed to be turning into some form of sea urchin. Fred looked at Percy with glee.\\\\\\\"You actually are joking, Perce.... I don't think I've heard you joke since you were \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"The air exploded. They had been grouped together, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and Percy, the two Death Eaters at their feet, one Stunned, the other Transfigured; and in that fragment of a moment, when danger seemed temporarily at bay, the world was rent apart, Harry felt himself flying through the air, and all he could do was hold as tightly as possible to that thin stick of wood that was his one and only weapon, and shield his head in his arms: He heard the screams and yells of his companions without a hope of knowing what had happened to them \\u00a8CAnd then the world resolved itself into pain and semidarkness: He was half buried in the wreckage of a corridor that had been subjected to a terrible attack. Cold air told him that the side of the castle had been blown away, and hot stickiness on his cheek told him that he was bleeding copiously. Then he heard a terrible cry that pulled at his insides, that expressed agony of a kind neither flame nor curse could cause, and he stood up, swaying, more frightened than he had been that day, more frightened, perhaps, than he had been in his life....And Hermione was struggling to her feet in the wreckage, and three redheaded men were grouped on the ground where the wall had blasted apart. Harry grabbed Hermione's hand as they staggered and stumbled over stone and wood.\\\\\\\"No \\u00a8C no \\u00a8C no!\\\\\\\" someone was shouting. \\\\\\\"No! Fred! No!\\\\\\\" And Percy was shaking his brother, and Ron was kneeling beside them, and Fred's eyes stared without seeing, the ghost of his last laugh still etched upon his face.\\u00a0\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Chapter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 10,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 38,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 38,\n        \"samples\": [\n          34,\n          37,\n          5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Book\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 7,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          7,\n          1,\n          3\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
